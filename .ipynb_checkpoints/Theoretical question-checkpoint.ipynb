In fact since for every element of the list we should at most compare it with all the other previous element in the list, we can even have, in the worst case, a computational cost of $n^2$.   \n",

    "If we have to take a decision considering only the execution time of the algorithm we may say that the merge sort is the best one since it's the faster one.  \n",
    "But even quick sort when we are not in particular case is a good one because it has a plus over merge sort.   \n",
    "In fact even if merge sort is very fast we can notice that in the function merge we can't reorder the list without creating a new list in which store temporarily the new sorted elements and so we use more memory. Instead in the quick sort we can sort all the elements in loco.   \n",
    "For this reason if we are in the cases in which quick sort takes a time complexity of $nlog(n)$ it's the best one to use."
