    "The average of people (that belong to the Atlas Obscura community) that visited a site is 418.87, instead the average of people that would like to visit a precise site is 913.72. Interesting is the information about the minimum (12 for \"numPeopleVisited\" and 406 for \"numPeopleWant\"): infact the value in the variable \"number of people want\" is much bigger than \"number of people visited\". What can be deduced is that even a touristic location that is very unknown and rarely visited create a lof of curiosity in the travelers. "

In fact since for every element of the list we should at most compare it with all the other previous element in the list, we can even have, in the worst case, a computational cost of $n^2$.   \n",
