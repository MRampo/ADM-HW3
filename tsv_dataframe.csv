0,City Hall Station,"subways,subterranean,infrastructure,subterranean sites,abandoned,architectural oddities,architecture",1834,8603,"The first New York City subway was built and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and opened on October 27, 1904, to the joy of New York elevated train and streetcar riders.The City Hall station on the IRT local track was lavished with fine architectural details, including glass tiles and large chandeliers. However, the Gustavino vaulted ceilings and skylights were lost on busy commuters, and the stop was one of the least-used in the system. It was the only station that did not have turnstiles installed by 1923, and the nearby Brooklyn Bridge stop was frequented by the express train and closer to connecting streetcars. Because of the curved platform, cars with center doors could not be used at this station unless they had specially modified door controls which allowed just the end doors to be opened. In 1945, the station was closed when platforms along the line were being lengthened to accommodate longer trains, and the number of passengers using this station dwindled to very few.Another factor leading to the decline of the station’s use was the fact that a person boarding the train at City Hall with a station intended destination below City Hall or in Brooklyn would wind up on the uptown platform at the Brooklyn Bridge station. They would then have to go upstairs and down to the downtown platform to continue their journey. It was much easier to walk the short distance at street level to the Brooklyn Bridge station.Up until the late 1990’s the passengers on the Lexington Avenue Local (today’s 6 train) had to disembark from the train at the Brooklyn Bridge stop. That is no longer the case. The skylights have been reopened, and the station lights turned back on. While passengers can not get out of the train and experience the City Hall Station as they once might have, they can stay on the train as it loops around on those tracks and heads back north.The New York City Transit Museum hosts periodic tours of the abandoned station; however, you must be a member of the museum to attend.

1,The Winchester Mystery House,"follies and grottoes,outsider architecture,eccentric homes,homes,architectural oddities,architecture",3723,5209,"In 1886 an eccentric woman named Sarah Winchester traveled from New Haven, Connecticut, to San Jose, California, to start a new life. She purchased a small eight-room farmhouse and started a small renovation project that would take 36 years and $5.5 million (in the money of the time), only stopping when she passed away in 1922.By the time she was done, the Winchester Mansion was a modern marvel with indoor plumbing, multiple elevators, a hot shower, and central heating. It had over 160 rooms and 40 bedrooms, 10,000 windows, and even 2 basements. Of course, that’s not all that’s unique about the house. Not all the 2,000 doors can be walked through—one leads to an 8-foot drop to a kitchen sink, another to a 15-foot drop into bushes in the garden below. Staircases lead straight to ceilings, expensive Tiffany stained-glass windows were installed in places where they would get no light, and there are more secret passages than Narnia. A particularly odd delight is a cabinet that, when opened, extends through 30 rooms of the house.No one is quite sure why Mrs. Winchester demanded constant changes to her very large house. Of course, there are stories.The most prevalent story is that Mrs. Winchester was being haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester rifle, which her late husband’s company had invented. After her husband passed away, a psychic told her that to evade the spirits, she would have to move out west, buy a home, and build nonstop. Some theories say she believed that as soon as construction was complete, she would die, while other theories suggest she built the house like a maze in order to keep her paranormal tormentors at bay and lost in the many intricacies of the building. As the theory goes, to avoid them she would sleep in a different bedroom every night and take labyrinthine paths through her own home.A massive earthquake struck the Bay Area in 1906 and toppled the top three stories of the house, damaging the other four stories along with it. Some say Sarah Winchester took this as a sign from the spirits that she was too close to completion and ordered the unfinished front half of the house to be boarded up. Though it’s open now, signs of damage from the earthquake are still clearly visible.In response to the ongoing claims of ghostly encounters and other paranormal phenomena on the property, in the early 1990s the Winchester management had a parapsychologist and paranormal investigator named Christopher Chacon conduct a full-scale scientific assessment of the property. The month-long, round-the-clock investigation included interviewing over 300 people regarding their experiences on the property, and analyzed every aspect of the environment for any unusual phenomena. In 2018, a horror film was made about the infamous house and the spirits that live within.",A peculiar mansion built by the troubled heir to the Winchester gun fortune. ,"Rosicrucian Park,Santana Row Chess Plaza,Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum","525 South Winchester Boulevard San Jose, California, 95128 United States",37.3189,-121.9506,mbisonAvoiding RegretPrestonWCollinDestination aficionadodennygerardbbprincemmarletteduommoonshaeDestination aficionadoLauren LevesqueQQueen Mary Historiandlc31723JFishttrykylaerjefferyttheloniusjazppatricelehockyeemgeedeeCollinddennygerardPPrestonWAvoiding RegretpierrejacquesHHenry,2008-11-21 00:00:00,"Santana Row Chess Plaza,Rosicrucian Park,Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum,John J.

3,Amityville Horror House,"hoaxes and pseudoscience,haunted,film locations,houses,homes",367,831,"On a cold November night in 1974, Amityville, New York resident Ronald DeFeo Jr. murdered his entire family in cold blood at their 112 Ocean Avenue residence. Totaling six victims, these murders were just the beginning of the story. Although the brutal murders were sensational in their own right it wasn’t until the house was purchased by the Lutz family that the home haunted its way into infamy. The Lutz family only lived in the Dutch Colonial house for less than a month, claiming that they were driven out by relentless paranormal events. Among the many claims made by the Lutz’s were swarms of flies, walls that oozed slime, spectral voices, and multiple sightings of a demonic, pig-like creature. Their account was popularized by a book entitled The Amityville Horror which subsequently spawned a film franchise that continues to produce haunted tales of the house nearly 40 years later. While most of the details of the Lutzs’ story have been refuted, true believers have blamed the haunting on everything from the vengeful spirits of the DeFeos to a Native American burial ground beneath the site. The house itself, with its distinctive gambrels and upper-story windows framing the brick chimney into something like a face, has become a horror icon and may be the distinctive ideal of a “haunted house” in American culture. The house at 112 Ocean Avenue is still a privately owned residence, and while signals of the paranormal have all but disappeared from the site as the years have passed, the memory of its tragic past will linger forever. ",The site of a tragic massacre that spawned a multimedia franchise. ,"The Long Island Puppet Theater,Fire Island Lighthouse,Pilgrim Psychiatric Center","112 Ocean Avenue Amityville, New York, 11701 United States",40.6665,-73.4143,EricGrundhauserMandrewPatinkinlendog666MartinRachelBrittanyZ,2013-10-17 00:00:00,"The Long Island Puppet Theater,Fire Island Lighthouse,Pilgrim Psychiatric Center,Ruins of King Zog's Estate","Conanicut Island Lighthouse,Lovell Health House,The Old Rock House,Georgetown Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amityville-horror-house
4,Yuma Territorial Prison,"prisons,crime and punishment",422,833,"On July 1, 1876, the first seven inmates entered the Territorial Prison at Yuma and were locked into the new cells they had built themselves.A total of 3,069 prisoners, including 29 women, lived within these walls during the prison’s thirty-three years of operation. Among the 29 women sentenced to Yuma was 16-year-old Maria Moreno, who shot her brother after he complained about the way she was dancing. There was also Pearl Hart. Pearl and her partner, Joe Boot, committed the last stagecoach robbery in Arizona. They robbed the Globe stage, and were caught very quickly. Joe Boot was sentenced to 30 years, and would later escape. Pearl Hart, after being tried twice, was given five years.The prison was known for its strict rules; weapons, gambling, and fighting were prohibited, as was littering and failing to bathe. Those who broke the rules could be forced to wear the ball and chain and more serious offenders would be sent to the dark cell. The dark cell was basically an excavation in the hillside measuring 15’ by 15’, with a cage in the center.Now a museum, the building houses photographs and colorful exhibits of those who once stayed there and the prison life they had to endure.

5,Tempelhof Airport,"architectural oddities,architecture",1485,834,"Tempelhof is Berlin’s oldest civilian airport. Built at a time when air travel was still in its infancy this airport exhibits many properties not found in modern airports.Works on future Tempelhof airport were started in 1923 by the German ministry of transport. At the time air travel was still a novelty, and prevalent idea was that it will be something akin to a railway travel. As railway terminals were most often placed in the centers of cities, location for new Berlin’s airport was chosen at the edge of city’s wider center, at the extensions of its main north-south axis, Frederickstrasse.The original terminal building, built in 1924, was replaced in the Nazi era by the current building designed by Prof. Ernst Sagebiel and the floor plan was designed to resemble an eagle’s spread wings in theme with the Nazi iconography. Construction of the eagle shaped building was interrupted by WWII, but the building is still one of the world’s largest in square footage, after the Parliament Palace built by former communist dictator Ceaucescou in Bucharest, Romania, several newer international airports, and the Pentagon in the US. There are four levels of tunnels and bunkers under Tempelhof airport, the lower two of which were burned and flooded by Russian troops before it was turned over to the US.Another feature of this airport, not found in its modern counterparts, is the giant canopy roof, high enough to accommodate most of the aircraft used by the airport even in the decades after WWII. The aircraft could taxi all the way to the building and under the canopy. Passengers could then board and disembark from the plane protected from the elements. The mile-long hangar roof was to have been laid in bleacher style tiers to form a stadium for spectators at air demonstrations.Tempelhof Airport ended up surrounded by urban development very quickly. Its awkward placement proved lucky for inhabitants of West Berlin, as it served as a drop off point of US organized airlift, during the Soviet blockade of the city in 1948. The airport remained in use throughout the Cold War. The northern half of the airport building was a US air force base until 1993, and many features remain, including the sprung-floor basketball court.  However the bowling alley has since been dismantled.In April of 2008, there was a referendum aimed at keeping Tempelhof Airport operational. However, this attempt at saving the airport failed. Ultimately, the pollution and hazards associated with a major airport in close proximity to residential areas motivated the shutdown of Tempelhof airport. The last commercial flight from Tempelhof happened on 30 October 2008.As of 2010, Templehof has been designated a huge park and public space, as well as bird/animal sanctuary. You can visit and go to Roller Disco or go for a run if you want to escape the hectic city.As of 2018, guided tours have been offered of the airport building several times per week. The entire building ihas been placed under German listed building status, and so provides a fascinating insight into its decades of history.",Berlin's old airport. ,"Schwerbelastungskörper,Café Strauss,Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars","Platz der Luftbrücke Berlin, 12101 Germany",52.4838,13.3877,stanestanespinkk d1fea822jetsettingfoolsmichelleCarismarkusosmanoc1mateSenorPancakePPartridgesspinkk d1fea822oosmanoc1jetsettingfoolsCarismarkusppattyannishBlindcolourFFacebook9700288mmbisonmichelle,2009-07-21 00:00:00,"Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars,Café Strauss,Schwerbelastungskörper,Museum of Unheard of Things","The Japanese-Style House of Prospect Park South,Herz-Jesu-Kirche,Castillo Pittamiglio,Murtoa Stick Shed",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tempelhof-airport
6,American Prohibition Museum,"speakeasies,prohibition,law,food museums,alcohol,museums",368,832,"When the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution outlawed alcohol as a deleterious delectation in 1920, it was the culmination of more than a century of campaigning by the national temperance movement. The American Prohibition Museum in Savannah, Georgia, follows the complex history of this movement, from its early days through the consequences of the 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition in 1933.Impressively, the museum entertains without being corny and educates without being preachy or pedantic. Visitors are greeted in the entrance by a Model T beer truck and myriad slogans, headlines, and “saloon art” that set the stage for the national debate. To reach the main exhibit halls on the second floor, one must climb a stairwell plastered with quotations on drinking and alcoholism and listen to an evangelical preacher proclaim the evils of liquor in a historical film.Appropriately enough, the museum’s story of Prohibition begins in a saloon, where a mannequin of the famous and fierce temperance advocate Carry Nation wields a hatchet over the bar (Nation was notorious for destroying saloons’ property with the weapon). Meanwhile, history comes alive as performing docents, dressed like barkeeps and flappers, answer questions and share saucy tales.Another exhibit covers the various illegal workarounds to Prohibition with the dark stillness of a moonshiner’s hideaway followed by a well-lit bootlegger tableau replete with weapons confiscated from mobsters. To avoid the gangster racket, you can escape into a nearby speakeasy, if you know the password. Once inside, guests can drink 1920s cocktails while listening to music from the golden age of jazz.The museum is remarkably comprehensive. All the usual suspects from popular perceptions of Prohibition are present, but the museum is also adept at interweaving Savannah’s local history into the chronicle while also revealing the many less obvious effects of Prohibition. For example, the engineering of cars was radically altered and improved as a result of creating faster and stronger bootlegger vehicles to outmaneuver G-men (slang for “government men,” or agents). Meanwhile, speakeasies paved the way for greater racial integration. There were, of course, negative effects, too: Nativism increased as Irish whiskey distillers and German beer brewers were targeted as lawbreakers.","Performers, intricate sets, and a real speakeasy tell the story of the 18th Amendment. ","The Marshall House,The Paris Market,Riverside Plant Hotel","209 W.

8,Church of Two Worlds,"death,religion,churches,sacred spaces",135,831,"Followers of the Spiritualist faith believe that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body and that believers can communicate with the dead. Spiritualists believe that the deceased can continue to grow and evolve in the afterlife, and as such we can learn a lot from communicating with them.In a quiet corner of Georgetown in Washington, D.C. you’ll find a Spiritualist house of worship, the Church of Two Worlds, referring of course to the spirit world and our Earthly realm. Housed in a former Methodist church building, it is the oldest Spiritualist church in the district, dating back to 1906. The first thing you notice about the Church of Two Worlds are the stained glass windows. Coupled with the tan brick exterior and lofty wooden doors, it looks like your typical local church. But the Church of Two Worlds is far from typical.Spiritualism reached its peak between the 1840s to the 1920s, reaching some 8 million followers at its height, mostly from the upper class. Today it is considerably more niche: Though the front doors of the Church of Two Worlds lead to a grand, spacious hall, the small audience means meetings are often held in a smaller room in the back.Church attendees receive a book of Spiritualist hymnals which are read from throughout the service. The church also offers healings, a type of Spiritualist ritual, group meditation, and literature on how to build your own private altar at home.

Mostly populated by the Brazilian free-tailed bat, the bat house and barn are also home to Southeastern and Evening bats.The original colony of bats was discovered after a fire destroyed Johnson Hall in 1987. The nearly 5,000 bats who had lived there then took up residence at several campus stadium locations. Though the musky odor of the bats and rain of guano during evening games didn’t please fans, it wasn’t until Governor Bob Martinez complained of the odor while attending an athletic event at Griffin Stadium that university officials decided something had to be done.  The first bat house was constructed in 1991. The stadiums were fitted with bat excluders, which allowed the bats to leave but not to return to roost. At first try, approximately 3,000 bats were caught in cages and relocated to the newly built bat house. Most left after only a night or two. In 1995, after years of using excluders at various campus locations and a variety of techniques to get the bats to stay at the house, it was discovered that what had been a small colony of mostly males bats had switched to a large colony of mostly females. Since then, the population has continued to increase. A second structure, the bat barn, was constructed in 2010.  The current population, estimated to be 300,000 bats, consumes more than two tons of insects a night. Observers are encouraged to come on warm, calm nights to watch the 10-20 minute show as the skies cloud with bats.  Viewers are warned that the bats often dip low to gather insects that have been attracted by carbon dioxide-laced exhalations … and to beware of falling urine and guano.",The world's largest occupied bat houses hold hundreds of thousands of flying mammals. ,"'Some Were Quite Blind',34th Street Graffiti Wall,Gainesville Solar Walk","Newins-Ziegler Hall Gainesville, Florida, 32603 United States",29.6454,-82.3457,Mom0jaipingupingdbaptistebreaingrambeesandfishingCollector of Experiences,2016-01-13 00:00:00,"'Some Were Quite Blind',34th Street Graffiti Wall,Gainesville Solar Walk,Tu Viện A Nan ","Nyamunini Island,Woodchester Mansion,World’s Largest Prairie Chicken,Sudwala Caves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/university-of-florida-bat-houses

Heineman found that the formation was in actuality a “vug,” or large cavity within a single rock. It took its name from the three-foot-long Celestine crystals jutting from the walls, many of which have been mined in order to be used as fireworks. As a result, the cave is likely less beautiful today than it once was, though it is also roomier, and many of the crystals remain in place.Though the setting—the world’s largest known geode, studded with crystals—is hard to beat on its own, you may as well take advantage of the accompanying Heineman winery tour, and explore the crystal cave with a bit of a buzz.

The park’s main attraction, a large, bright blue geodesic dome, is home to a bakery filled with blueberry pastries, breads, and sweets. The entire park is a bright shade of blue.This seven-acre space is covered with giant marine buoys painted to resemble blueberries and a blueberry-themed mini golf course decorated with a shipwreck, a lighthouse, a grandfather clock, and a large blueberry pie that was once a TV satellite dish. If you win the golf game, you get to take your pick of one of the fresh veggies growing in the patches throughout the grounds of the course. Appropriately, Wild Blueberry Land is run by a baker and a farmer, Dell and Marie Emerson. Dell, a former researcher at the University of Maine’s blueberry farm (the only wild blueberry research farm in the U.S.), cares for the 220-acre Wild Wescogus Berries farm while Marie does the baking. The park is backdropped by Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park and looks out over the Pleasant River. The thin glacial soil of the Emersons’ Wescogus farm (“Wescogus” means “above the water” in the language of the Passamaquoddy Native American tribe) and the northern climate provide the perfect conditions for wild blueberries to flourish. The owners hope that the theme park stands as a dedication to small-scale farming: The park has an educational program that teaches youth about farming, gardening, and preservation, and offers visitors information about the history of agriculture in the area.Today, in addition to snacking on sweet berries, drivers pull off the highway to marvel at the blue land. Even when it’s closed during the winter season, people take pictures by the domed building covered in snow. There are so many pictures of the famous local landmark online, Marie has said, it’s like the Wild Blueberry Land building has its own cult following. ","This colorful theme park dedicated the official fruit of Maine serves sweet, tasty treats. ","Maine Central Model Railroad,Nellie Chapin Day Memorial,Maine Coast Sardine History Museum","1067 US HWY 1 Columbia Falls, Maine United States",44.6487,-67.7069,Lauren J Youngbasimonica11hana,2016-08-16 00:00:00,"Maine Central Model Railroad,Nellie Chapin Day Memorial,Maine Coast Sardine History Museum,Old Pond Railway Trail","Sadpol Strawberry,Monticello's Vegetable Garden and Fruitery,Robert Is Here,Giardino Pantesco",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wild-blueberry-land

Who better to collect and display the history of the New York Transit system?Housed in the abandoned Court Street station, the museum features “Steel, Stone, and Backbone” about the building of the subways. The oldest artifacts in the museum are in the “On the Streets: Trolleys and Streetcars” section, which also describes the evolution of fuel technology in buses. On the lower (platform) level of the Museum are featured subway cars dating back to 1916 and wooden elevated cars dating back to 1903 as well as other miscellaneous equipment used in subway operation.Do you remember old tokens? They were the predominate fare on New York Subways and buses from 1953 until 2003, when the brass coins were replaced by the now-ubiquitous MetroCard. A permanent collection at the New York Transit Museum presents the token-operated turnstiles and the ticket chopping machines dating back to 1904; visitors enter the Museum through the same street entrance their grandparents once did. The Museum has an Annex/Gallery in Grand Central Terminal (to the left of the Station Master’s office)The original Court Street station opened in 1936 as part of an intended connection to Manhattan (approximately where the World Trade Center station on the E line is today), it served HH trains until 1946 when it was closed due to lack of use and lack of funds to build the tunnel to Manhattan. After that was used to film scenes for many movies — the opening scene of the 1974 movie The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 shows a train entering the station (with a false wall on the right side). In 1976, the New York City Transit Authority wanted to contribute to the US Bicentennial celebration and opened the New York City Transit Exhibit in July 1976.The station was only intended to remain until September 1976, but public reaction was so overwhelming it remained open and eventually became the New York Transit Museum. Responsibility of the museum was subsequently transferred to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to allow for expansion of exhibits to include other MTA facilities, such as Metro-North & Long Island Railroads, and MTA Bridges & Tunnels.",Ride the subways of yesteryear. ,"Gage & Tollner,Atlantic Avenue Tunnel,Fliers and Explorers Globe","99 Schermerhorn St Brooklyn, New York, 11201 United States",40.6905,-73.99,Rebekah OttoAllanmbisontransitmuseumpressHermit09Hannah FrishbergHermit09AAllanthegenxjourneyttransitmuseumpressHannah Frishbergmmbison,2010-01-24 00:00:00,"Gage & Tollner,Atlantic Avenue Tunnel,Fliers and Explorers Globe,The Remains of Abraham & Straus Department Store","Gran Vía Museum and Palacios Pavilion,Collection of Peddler Bicycles,Stazione Neapolis,Carpetana Metro Station Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-transit-museum

The effects of erosion on the characteristically geometrical basalt created the stair-step formations and symmetrical mounding that splits the creek into two glittering curtains over the 226-foot drop amidst thick carpets of moss. At the bottom, the water pools but does not flow on via any outlet, draining instead into the ground via the porous lava rock deposited there over millennia by the nearby volcanoes known as the Three Sisters.There are actually two sections of Proxy Falls: Upper Proxy Falls and Lower Proxy Falls. The lower waterfall is the famous one, being far more dramatic and picturesque than the 126-foot gradual cascades that comprise the upper waterfall.Both falls can easily be reached via a hike of less than a mile on Proxy Falls Trail, which takes visitors on a walk through coniferous forests and open lava fields before arriving at the falls. The trail is open year-round, but is subject to occasional inaccessibility in the winter due to snow (unless, of course, you brought your skis or snowshoes).",This frequently-photographed waterfall takes only a short hike to visit. ,"Dee Wright Observatory,Sahalie Falls,No Name Lake","OR-242 McKenzie Bridge, Oregon, 97413 United States",44.1618,-121.9278,KaritxahrnickRHyzerleslipetersonWookiee Monster,2016-02-05 00:00:00,"Dee Wright Observatory,No Name Lake,Sahalie Falls,Clear Lake","Cascade Falls,Krushuna Falls,Valaste Waterfall,Njupeskärs Vattenfall ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/proxy-falls

Given the odds of making it out of the tar intact, the fossilized dragonflies are a bit of a miracle.How these plant and animal fossils came to be so concentrated in the middle of Los Angeles is simple: There is a fault line here that allows the tar to work its way to the surface, collecting into bubbly black pools. The breadth and depth of the fossils they’ve excavated and cataloged over the years is pretty incredible, and more are bubbling up every day.While the most impressive fossils have come from creatures like sabertooth cats, dire wolves and mastodons, it’s easy to overlook some of the rarest on display.Invertebrates, particularly dragonflies, are uncommon to find intact, but they are important pieces of the puzzle, helping to put together a more complete picture of climate, plant pollination and the full Pleistocene food chain. Their rarity results mostly from their delicacy, and just the right conditions must be met so they don’t turn into dust or completely dissolve in the process of tar removal and fossil preservation.The campus of the La Brea Tar Pits and adjacent Handcock Park encompasses 100 deposits of the sticky stuff (naturally occurring asphalt, or asphaltum), as well as the George C. Page Museum and a working Fossil Lab. Part of their mission is the discovery, research and preservation of the prehistoric flora and fauna that populated a slice of the Pleistocene period (about 40,000 years ago to about 11,000 years ago) in southern California.",These delicate buggers are some of the rarest fossils that have bubbled up from the Tar Pits. ,"Urban Light,The LAPD Kōban,Petersen Automotive Vault","La Brea Tar Pits and Museum 5801 Wilshire Boulevard Los Angeles, California, 90036",34.0638,-118.3554,lastpearlFred Cherrygardennathanwaustinmatejondi letnap,2016-06-22 00:00:00,"Urban Light,Petersen Automotive Vault,The LAPD Kōban,'Dan the Miner'","The Mauer 1 Jawbone,Bohart Museum of Entomology,Joe Webb Peoples Museum,Jurassic Museum of Asturias",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-brea-tar-pits-dragonfly-fossils
17,The Sailing Stones of Racetrack Playa,"martian landscapes,geological oddities,natural wonders,ecosystems,geology,nature",421,2415,"There is something utterly magical about the sailing stones of The Racetrack playa in Death Valley, California. Scattered about the desert are large rocks with mysterious trails left behind them. The trails show that these rocks have rolled and zig-zagged across the ground, sometimes for as long as 860 feet. The trails last for years before fading, so it is almost impossible to predict when the stones will move or how fast they move.The sailing stones have been studied since the early 1900s, and researchers have suggested several theories to explain stones’ mysterious movement. In the early 2000s, a team of scientists set out to find the answers. They named a group of stones and did surveys of the area over a seven-year period. A 700-pound block dubbed Karen, which didn’t move at all while under study, was entirely missing when they returned years later. A sighting of the 700-pound Karen was made over half a mile from the survey site. Later teams have studied the phenomenon and determined that melting winter ice sheets are responsible for the movement of the stones. These stones are composed of dolomite and syenite. Studies show that the highest chance of spotting the movement of the stones is during the winter months when conditions are just right. ",The rocks in this arid basin leave trails of movement behind them.  ,"Saline Valley Hot Springs,Cerro Gordo,Teakettle Junction","Inyo, California United States 36.6816, -117.5633Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyTeakettle Junction5.56 milesSaline Valley Hot Springs14.45 milesCerro Gordo16.26 miles",36.6816,-117.5633,DylanalivetocurebqalicewholoveshorsesUshankaHenrySamniteJJustin VtthenoblewomanTeaAndCoffeeLoverzenmanaalicewholoveshorsesaalivetocurebqsslcjd82TTIMMAHjjeffreyrbadgermordred350BBrianDunningHHenryUUshankaBBeanoliniaack sedSSamnite,2011-09-01 00:00:00,"Teakettle Junction,Saline Valley Hot Springs,Cerro Gordo,Marble Bath","The Smoking Hills,Námafjall,Fairy Glen,Mt.

18,Carlsbad Caverns,"caves,ecosystems",2152,2419,"Caving, particularly in an unexplored cave, is a dangerous hobby. Even with the most modern equipment, many things can go wrong, and a serious injury can trap the caver underground.However in 1898, a 16 year old named Jim White climbed down into what would come to be known as the Carlsbad caverns, and with only food, water, homemade torches, some string and friend known only as “the kid” or “pothead,” they began mapping one of the largest caves systems in the world.White had discovered the cave when he was riding his horse through the Chihuahuan Desert and witnessed what looked like a black tornado spewing out of the ground. What turned out to be thousands of bats escaping the cave, led the teenage Jim right to a hole in the middle of the New Mexico desert. In his words “I found myself gazing into the biggest and blackest hole I had ever seen, out of which the bats seemed literally to boil” Naturally, Jim climbed right in.Jim “crept cat-like across a dozen dangerous ledges and past many tremendous openings” seeing amazing geological features such as stalactites and stalagmites, soda straws, flowstone, pools of water, rimstone dams and a huge area known today as the Bat Cave. At one point Jim’s weak kerosene lamp ran out of fuel and he was plunged into darkness “as though a million tons of black wool descended upon me.” Luckily he had a refill and was able to make his way back out. But this was just the beginning for both Jim and the cave.Jim would later return with the unnamed Mexican friend known as “pothead” and spend three entire days exploring the tunnel, and like Tom Sawyer used string to map their way and avoid getting lost. What they saw was amazing and included what is now know to be the second largest cave chamber in the world, the “Hall of Giants,” some 4,000 feet long, 625 feet wide, and 350 feet high at its highest point.Among the other cave features found were the Green Lake Room named for its beautiful mineral green lake, a area known as the Mystery Room, named for a mysterious sound heard here, and the “bottomless pit” discovered to be 140 feet deep but to be filled with a soft sand so that stones dropped in made no sound when they landed.The Carlsbad caverns would go on to be used as a source of guano for fertilizing California fruit orchards (with a giant bucket being used until 1925 to transport both bat poop and people in and out of the caves), tested as a nuclear bunker (the military watched the water in the Green Lake Room for ripples as they set off atomic weapons in the nearby New Mexico desert, no ripples were seen) was visited by numerous luminaries such as Amelia Earhart, Will Rogers, Ty Cobb and even Robert Wadlow, the worlds tallest man.In 1979 the caves were the site of a short lived hostage scenario (the four men gave themselves up after roughly 5 hours), and in 1985 after years of failed attempts, Jim Goodbar, and Mike Queen used balloons to float a rope up to a stalactite, were able to secure a climbing rope to it and gained access to a previously inaccessible part of the cave. They named the two rooms accessed this way the Spirit World and the Balloon Ballroom.Since opening to the public many millions of visitors have come through the cave, but this hasn’t made the cave any less dangerous for cavers. In 1991 a caver broke her leg 1000 feet inside the nearby Lechuguilla Cave system and it took 150 rescuers four days to get her out.Jim White died in 1946 but he is still very present in the cave, as he named many of the rooms and formations in the Carlsbad cave system. The names “Big Room, New Mexico Room, King’s Palace, Queen’s Chamber, Papoose Room, and Green Lake Room” and formations such as the “Totem Pole, Witch’s Finger, Giant Dome, Bottomless Pit, Fairyland, Iceberg Rock, Temple of the Sun, and Rock of Ages” all bear the sound of youthful jauntiness that send the sixteen year old White into the cave in the first place.Bats too still pour out of the cave entrance just as they did in 1898, though this time instead of a single 16 year old on horseback, they are seen by dozens of tourists gathered around to watch the spectacle unfold. ","The second-largest cave chamber in the world was discovered in 1898 by a 16-year-old and a friend known as ""Pothead."" ","McKittrick Canyon,Guadalupe Peak,Lechuguilla Cave","Carlsbad Caverns National Park Carlsbad, New Mexico, 88220 United States",32.1753,-104.4438,Silvia LucimbisonuuxaulmylifefortheloreJames RiccieevilgreentrianglemylifefortheloreBryannabreaingramuuuxaulJames RiccigarycasciopollardldSilvia LuciFFacebook806333813mmbison,2009-11-17 00:00:00,"Lechuguilla Cave,McKittrick Canyon,Guadalupe Peak,Bottomless Lakes State Park","Lacy's Caves,Caves of Filopappou Hill,Ice Cave of Bixby State Preserve,Corviano",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carlsbad-caverns
19,Hellam Township,"mystery spots and gravity hills,rites and rituals",235,2414,"Hellam Township was founded in 1739, a pleasant little backwater in a corner of York, Pennsylvania. It boasts rich forestry, lakes, wildlife and waterfalls… although residents are somewhat less thrilled by the presence of an alleged hellgate in the township. The Seven Gates of Hell feature is a popular piece of urban folklore, a series of portals in the Hellam Township which open an entrance to the fiery pit below. There are many different tellings of the tale; though one of the more popular versions links the gates to a former insane asylum on the outskirts of the town. This story describes a fire at the asylum in the nineteenth century, which allowed the dangerous inmates to escape. Running wild, many of them were recaptured, beaten, or killed. Other tormented souls were trapped inside a series of gates, which they haunt to this day.It is said that only the first gate is visible by daylight, and this lies on private land just off the town’s Trout Run Road. By night, other gates become visible in this quiet, wooded corner of the township. Passing through all seven will take the visitor straight to hell, and it’s reported that nobody has yet passed five and returned to talk about the experience.Another story deals with a local doctor, accounts of whom range from eccentric to psychotic. He was said to have owned the land, on which he built a series of peculiar gates leading deeper and deeper into the forest.The myth has caused a lot of upset and frustration for the residents of Hellam Township, and the township’s own website has denounced the stories as nonsense. There was never an asylum on Trout Run Road, while the notorious doctor – who did in fact exist – only ever built one gate on his property. Other claims that Hellam Township was named after hell itself, are also dispelled; the name comes from a corruption of “Hallamshire,” an area of South Yorkshire in England.Try as they might to dissuade visitors however, Hellam Township still receives its fair share of hell seekers – as well as numerous satanic cults, who reputedly use Hellam as a meeting place from time to time. There have been numerous instances of residents calling the police, as visitors trespass through private land in search of the gates.","Hellam Township is reputed to feature seven remote gates, which when passed through in the right order, open an entrance to hell. ","Conewago Potholes,The White Cliffs of Conoy,Haines Shoe House","4156 Trout Run Road Hellam Township Hellam, Pennsylvania, 17406",40.0353,-76.6629,Darmon Richterbanklouderjohnmurphy042000missyfabioulousAFRiff42bbanklouderjohnmurphy042000RRiff42sscottbohlencathyb10811mmissyfabioulousAAFRachel,2013-07-02 00:00:00,"The White Cliffs of Conoy,Haines Shoe House,Conewago Potholes,National Watch and Clock Museum ","Saimaluu Tash,Church of Santa Luciella ai Librai,San Michele Arcangelo Hypogeum,Tateishi-sama",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hellam-township

The site is the former base of the Olinger family’s funeral empire, which at one point was responsible for organizing half of Denver’s funerals, even once housing the body of Buffalo Bill Cody for six months in 1917 while Wyoming and Colorado argued over who would provide his final resting place (Colorado won). When the space was purchased by its new owners, they immediately embraced the spot’s morbid history. The rooftop neon sign that used to proclaim “Olinger Mortuaries” was barely even altered, with the capitol “O” simply being turned out and the word “mortuaries” being slightly altered so that the current sign reads, “Linger Eatuaries.” The funereal history continues on in the interior as well where the old A/C units have been turned into hanging lamps, glass-topped metal conveyor belts are used as tables, and a church pew is used as the host’s stand. The ground floor boasts large garage doors that once welcomed corpse-laden hearses and now open simply to offer a breeze for summer diners. Below the restaurant in the basement level is now a mixed use retail space that includes an athletic club somewhat ironically, as this space was once Olinger’s embalming space where the bodies were preserved.Other deathly touches abound in the eatuary such as water served from formaldehyde bottles and a picture from one of cinema’s more touching paeans to death, Harold and Maude. To the restaurant’s credit, all of the morbid accents do nothing to make the site unappetizing, possibly because of the constant reminder that you can’t eat when you’re dead.    ","Once a mortuary that held the remains of Buffalo Bill, this Denver hotspot is now a death-fixated restaurant. ","The Miller Building,My Brother's Bar ,Ralph Carr Memorial, Sakura Square","2030 West 30th Avenue Denver, Colorado, 80211 United States",39.7595,-105.0114,ShannonMDunnTaterchipsrugby007Collector of Experiences,2014-09-17 00:00:00,"My Brother's Bar ,The Miller Building,Ralph Carr Memorial, Sakura Square,Daniels and Fisher Tower","Bunsen ,La Puerta Falsa,Carton King Creative Park,Kulturtårnet",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/linger-eatuary

Many have suggested that the collection be returned to Turkey.When the Pergamon Museum was severely damaged during an air strike at the end of the Second World War, many objects were stolen. Although many of the major pieces were safely secured, the Red Army collected all of the loose museum items, either as war booty or for safe keeping from the looting and fires that were then raging in Berlin.In 1958, most of the objects returned to East Germany, but a few significant items of the collection simply remained in Russia.

22,The King's Cross Ice Well,"industrial,abandoned",317,2401,"In Victorian Britain, fresh ice was a rare commodity. It was used largely for the refrigeration of meat and dairy products, as well as in place of anaesthetic for many surgical procedures. Ice also became something of a decadent luxury amongst those who could afford it; drinks served with ice cubes stood as a testament to wealth and distinction.The two Victorian ice wells located behind King’s Cross Station in central London were constructed by the Italian-Swiss immigrant, Carlo Gatti. Arriving in London in 1847, Gatti was an entrepreneur who became famous as an ice cream manufacturer, importing his frozen ingredients from Norway by way of ship and canal boat. At the time, most ice was harvested from frozen ponds and rivers and had to stored in underground vaults to slow the thawing process. Gatti’s ice warehouse in London consisted of two conjoined wells, each with a depth of forty-two feet and measuring a diameter of thirty feet, which between them were able to store many tons of natural ice. From here Gatti formed something of an empire, supplying ice to clients far and wide across London. By the time he died in 1878, Carlo Gatti was a millionaire.The King’s Cross ice wells were in use until 1904. By this point however, artificial ice production was becoming more common, and Gatti’s legacy was rendered obsolete. The cellars were covered and forgotten for many years while the ice warehouse itself was converted into a horse and cart depot.More recently, the building has been developed into the London Canal Museum. The ice wells beneath have been emptied, cleaned and lit, and can be viewed from a special observation platform. Additionally, once a year the museum invites visitors to descend into the ice wells to experience the history of the site up close.Just in case you can’t make it to London for a visit however, the museum has also installed a web-controlled camera inside the cellar, allowing users to tour these Victorian ice wells using their web browser.",A subterranean ice warehouse that has lain hidden beneath central London for over a century is now open to the public. ,"Platform 9 3/4,London Underground Labyrinths,Word on the Water","12-13 New Wharf Rd London, England, N1 United Kingdom",51.5342,-0.12,Darmon RichterlittlebrumbleSEANETTAtomdoel,2014-07-10 00:00:00,"Word on the Water,Platform 9 3/4,London Underground Labyrinths,Joseph Grimaldi Park","Guignard Brick Works,Natur-Park Südgelände,La Siberia,Aldridge Sawmill",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-king-s-cross-ice-well-london-england

The structure, along with its attendant stone path seems to have been established by the Knights Templar. Down the centuries, the little church has been sacked, burned, and otherwise destroyed, but was rebuilt each time.The church is still standing on the little rock, looking, maybe more enticing than ever, its history simply adding to its charm. The ancient bridge and the hundreds of stairs leading up to the church are still a popular tourist attraction and can be accessed by a well-groomed modern path. Along the bridge are smaller staircases that lead down to reflecting spots at the edge of the water.

25,Court of Mysteries,"occult,secret,outsider art,houses,homes,abandoned,architectural oddities,architecture",394,2401,"There are two reasons to build your house in the dead of night illuminated only by a small lantern and the moon.Reason one: You are a believer in Eastern mythology and Occult spiritualism building a mysterious and cryptic brick building modeled on a Hindi temple and covered in five-pointed stars and arcane patterns. The light of the moon bathes the structure in unseen power, forging a connection to planes of existence beyond space and time. Reason two: You are a bricklayer from Pennsylvania working in Santa Cruz in the 1930s and you would rather not deal with inspectors or building permits. These reasons are not mutually exclusive. Built by Kenneth Kitchen, who also went by Claire, Clarke, and Clarence, the abandoned house at 519 Fair Ave is known by all in the area as the “Court of Mysteries.” It is unclear if the builder Kenneth Kitchen ever called it by that name. Kenneth and his brother Raymond were a bricklayer and a mason respectively, and they built numerous homes around Santa Cruz. They worked together, though they are rumored to have quarreled often and were seen fist-fighting in the streets of Santa Cruz on more than one occasion.After a decade of building homes, Kenneth bought his own property in then-sleepy Santa Cruz, raised goats on it (and sold their dairy products) and began building his unusual home. Kenneth is said to have hauled all the bricks himself in the back of a fancy car and built the home modeled after a Yogi temple. Today it is particularly the gateway with its two towers and archway which inspires so much curiosity. Known as the “Gate of Prophesy” it once held windows through which the sun would stream, and which were lit at night. Though the windows are long gone it still holds a mysterious triangular relief, which some believe is meant to align with the temple’s chimney, before a great catastrophe or even apocalypse. The well house on the property, described as crypt-like, was also once surrounded by four minarets which were smashed by a sledgehammer in the 1990s. There are tales that the house, now empty except for a coating of graffiti, once held shells decorated with astrological symbols. There are hidden symbols and messages on the outside and inside of the main building in addition to the well building and on the main entrance, such as triangles and morse-code style dashes and dots.Even stranger is the story that during WWII, Kenneth erected a “submarine stopping device,” in his yard – not a particularly crazy idea, since 10 ships on the coast of Santa Cruz were attacked by Japanese submarines and six people killed – built out of a large metal wheel with the electronics held in the well house. According to one source (an unnamed interviewee in the oft-cited The Sidewalk Companion to Santa Cruz Architecture), the device actually worked and caused problems for the US Navy.Kenneth left Santa Cruz in 1957, and his path after that is lost to history. Local historians have traced all of his relatives, but after 1957, Kenneth, aka Claire, Clarke and Clarence Kitchen vanished from the historical record. After his disappearance, the house was briefly turned into a Greek Church earning the nickname the “Unorthodox Chapel.” It has been abandoned since the 1990s. Kenneth is said to have died three separate times, which may have contributed to his fascination with occult sciences, symbology, and numerology.While the home is the subject of many rumors, the truth is little is known about exactly why Kenneth built it in the way he did. He was said to have learned his trade during WWI in Turkey so there is speculation that he also picked up some Eastern and Occult religious ideas while he was there. (If he was there at all.)Regardless, today the “Court of Mysteries” stands out from its suburban neighbors, giving generation after generation of curious Santa Cruz teenagers a starting place for tall tales and mystic revelations. Update February 2016: This historic landmark property was purchased. The new owners are working with the city of Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz Historic Preservation Committee to develop a personal family compound and restore and repair the landmark artifacts. The new owners are an artist and a writer who are looking forward to returning to Santa Cruz and making this unique property their primary residence.Update September 2017: There is now a caretaker living on site at the property, and engaged in some repairs. He confirmed that the property now belongs to a small local development company that is hoping to restore the building and add a second story the main building. He suspects the brothers built at least one level beneath the ground floor, and that they are working with structural architects and engineers to determine the best method to handle the restoration and excavation, with a target of late 2018 to physically start the work.Update July 2018. The property is fenced off. There are workers inside tearing it down piece by piece. According to several locals, the property has been up for sale for years. Update September 2018: The entire main house is torn down. All the remains are the front arches inside the fence.Update October 2019: The new owners/stewards of this amazing property have restored around 90% of the house and are close to completing the rebuild of the property. ","A strange house built only at night, with rumored mystic inspiration.  ","Santa Cruz Mystery Spot,Santa Cruz Surfing Museum,Bigfoot Discovery Museum","515 Fair Ave Suite 380 Santa Cruz, California, 95060",36.9549,-122.0453,jmarcusfrostMartindnabanaszak2randyloebJames RiccilordmaritzensmytheWWookieeStampede22randyloebmxhurley01ddnabanaszakllordmaritzensmythessuperbliss3aartinamortonJames RiccicchristyjohnstoniitsmebrandiMMartinAvoiding Regret,2013-04-11 00:00:00,"Santa Cruz Surfing Museum,Santa Cruz Mystery Spot,Bigfoot Discovery Museum,SS Palo Alto","Baddesley Clinton,La Maison Sculptée ,Biltmore Estate's Secret Passages,Monroe Allison House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/court-of-mysteries
26,Devils Postpile National Monument,"cliffs,martian landscapes,geological oddities,parks,ecosystems,geology",805,2397,"The battling forces of fire and ice created the Devils Postpile: over 400 unusually symmetrical columns of basalt towering six hundred feet high, on the eastern side of the sierras, just outside of Mammoth.The columns began forming roughly a hundred thousand years ago when a large lava flow from the Upper Soda Springs area began cooling. As the molten lava cooled slowly and evening, vertical joints – cracks in the rocks due to expansion – formed the multi-sided columns. The basalt columns – like the giant’s causeway in Ireland – formed naturally into hexagonal columns. The columns then came into contact with a massive moving glacier that left highly visible glacial striations and a glacial polish.Three geologic features make the Devils Postpile unique. First, the lack of common horizontal jointing. Second, the uncommon symmetry of the columns are found only a few places throughout the world, Finally, the visible marks left by the glacial movement.The Devils Postpile has twice been threatened with destruction. The first, in the late 1800s, was when gold was found near Mammoth and the area around the Devils Postpile were removed from the sanctuary of Yosemite National Park. Luckily, the columns were spared being dynamited in the search for gold.The second threat, in the early 1900s, was when a proposed hydroelectric dam called for the destruction of the postpile. Thanks to the persuasive voice of Californian Walter L. Huber, president Taft turned the Devils Postpile into a National Monument in 1911.Today the Devils Postpile National Monument offers an active hiking and camping locations and breath taking view including that of the 100 foot Rainbow Falls.Rock column formations like this are very rare, but can be seen in a few other places in the world including the Frenchman Coulee in Washington, Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Fingal’s Cave in Scotland.","Towering basalt columns, a creation of fire and ice. ","Hot Creek Geological Site,Mono Mills,Obsidian Dome","Minaret Summit Rd Mammoth Lakes, California, 93546 United States",37.6501,-119.074,TrembisonanitaandreneeadventuresjDreamsmarcinwehoalicjafowleraanitaandreneeadventureszzbq6qm4mt4jjDreamskkeenansekoLV2BATCaalexwbakkermmarcinwehoaalicjafowleraamdhamptonssalmson2a2Avoiding Regretmmbison,2009-10-25 00:00:00,"Obsidian Dome,Hot Creek Geological Site,Mono Mills,Panum Crater","The Smoking Hills,Great Kobuk Sand Dunes,Kanaio Coast,Cueva Clara",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-postpile-national-monument

The distinctive tile work in the gallery is known as “Gustavino” tiles, named for the patented material and methods of Spanish tile worker Rafael Guastavino, whose meticulous work and herringbone patterns can be admired here and elsewhere in the city.In 2012 the tilework was slated for a restoration, with promises abounding from the MTA that the work would not disturb the cherished acoustic anomaly.Neither a common nor a super rare phenomenon, whispering galleries exist around the world, both accidental and intentional.

28,Cathedral Park,"intriguing environs,ecosystems,animals",1309,2392,"Portland, Oregon is home to the most parks, as well as the biggest (Forest Park) and the smallest (Mill Ends Park, a colony for leprechauns) in the country. But, even in a city that’s world famous for its parks, one stands out as exceptionally unique.Cathedral Park lies in North Portland nestled on the banks of the Willamette river in the unsurprisingly named Cathedral Park Neighborhood. A quiet unassuming location beneath the St. Johns bridge, where thousands of commuters pass overhead daily. Walking beneath the towering cathedral-like footings of the St. John’s bridge with the sun rays streaking through the morning mist, and the trees of Forest Park dancing in the distance as a cool breeze passes through them, it’s nothing short of a religious experience.It’s hard to imagine that this park was not part of the original design of the bridge. In fact, it was built in 1980, a good 50 years after the bridge and its splendid arches were put in place. Until then, the area beneath the eastern end of the bridge was likened to a junkyard by Howard Galbraith, the “honorary mayor” of the then unincorporated St. Johns. He organized a drive that raised $7.5 million to build the park.In June of 1980, upon completion, the Cathedral Park Committee sealed a time capsule into the Wall of History in the Memorial Garden in the park. The time capsule will be opened in 2030. Directions for how to find the capsule, which is hidden behind a particular stone, are kept safe and sound with the Oregon History Center.The site is steeped in history, thought to be one of the 14 Lewis and Clark landing sites in the Vancouver-Portland area: William Clark and eight men camped there on April 2 1806. It has also been a fishing and camping site for local Indian tribes. In 1847 the founder of St. Johns, James John, trapped and hunted on the site and operated a ferry to the fishing town of Linnton across the Willamette River. In 1931, the St. Johns Bridge was built on the site with 400-ft towers and a main span of 1,207 feet. It is the only steel suspension bridge in Portland and is designated as an official historical landmark.The park is also home to many festivals, concerts, and community events. The Cathedral Park Jazz Festival, started in 1981, is the oldest and largest free jazz and blues event west of the Mississippi. The park also includes a boat dock, boat ramp, picnic tables, and an excellent off-leash area for tossing around a frisbee with man’s best friend.","A heavenly experience, right here on Terra Firma. ","Paul Bunyan Statue,The Witch's Castle,Casa Diablo Vegan Strip Club","6905 N Philadelphia Ave. Portland, Oregon, 97203 United States",45.5886,-122.758,jamesbVat the TravelerMosStephmlee106breaingramhawkandviperVVat the TravelerbreaingramMMosStephmmlee106ddauerbach675hawkandvipermmbison,2009-08-10 00:00:00,"Paul Bunyan Statue,Casa Diablo Vegan Strip Club,The Witch's Castle,Vaux's Swifts at Chapman School","Cheyenne Bottoms,Ghost Ranch,Sudwala Caves,Tegel Creek Water Buffaloes",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-park

So where else would you open a museum dedicated to things that go bump in the night?Any wooded area is bound to have at least one Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti sighting, and Littleton, North Carolina is no exception. However, when residents in this tiny town see strange creatures, they get local cryptozoologist Stephen Barcelo on the case.Barcelo isn’t just a one-man operation. He founded Littleton’s Cryptozoology & Paranormal Museum, which is surprisingly well-stocked for the size of the town. It’s here that he collects and displays his research artifacts, as well as other items that would be of interest to fans of the paranormal. There are casts of Bigfoot prints, many of them made by Barcelo himself. Mrs. Beasley the haunted doll is reported to move about in her locked case. UFO sighting testimonials accompany photographic evidence of their appearances in the night sky. There is also a section of fakes—such as a Feejee mermaid. Barcelo also hosts ghost tours of Littleton, and displays ghost hunting equipment at the museum.The museum and the tours educate guests on the paranormal, but also on the history of Littleton, something Barcelo holds equally important. Since the museum’s founding in 2015, more cryptic sightings have been reported than ever before. Perhaps this is because people now have someplace to report their experiences, but Barcelo maintains that the sightings are becoming more frequent because the local logging industry is encroaching on the creatures’ habitat. ","Bigfoot prints, Feejee mermaids, and haunted dolls on display in a tiny North Carolina town. ","Tomb of William Jeffreys,Brady C Jefcoat Museum,Mercury Cougar","300 N Main St Littleton, North Carolina, 27850 United States",36.4333,-77.9163,Cryptozoology Paranomal MuseumMolly McBride Jacobsonc0rriganwillstrohktbwarren,2016-09-02 00:00:00,"Tomb of William Jeffreys,Brady C Jefcoat Museum,Mercury Cougar,Whirligig Park (Formerly Acid Park)","International Cryptozoology Museum,Archive of the Afterlife ,Great Orme Summit Complex UFO Room,Stagecoach Inn Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cryptozoology-paranomal-museum

32,Barker Ranch,"manson family,doomsday cults,serial killer,cults,murder,disaster areas",67,831,"It is easy to think of Charles Manson as simply a mass murderer—after all, he surely was one. What people tend to forget is that the murders were part of a grander scheme to bring about the apocalypse. The Manson family was first and foremost a Doomsday cult.Of course Arlene Barker didn’t know that when she rented her California ranch to them. An older lady, Mrs. Barker believed that the Mansons were a group of musicians who needed space to practice. As thanks for letting them stay there, Manson even gave her a Beach Boys gold record, which he had gotten from Dennis Wilson (it is unclear if the record was a gift or stolen goods).Barker Ranch is located in a rocky valley in the Panamint Range. Bluch and Helen Thomason began construction around 1940, and originally used the site a storage facility for their mining activity nearby. They built a small cabin, which eventually became a vacation property. The Barker family bought the property in 1956, and expanded the cabin into a larger house. Once the Mansons moved in, the ranch became one of the locations from which they planned a series of murders in an attempt to start an apocalyptic race-war, his “Helter Skelter.”But as Manson orchestrated the killings of nine people, his followers also conducted raids in Death Valley stealing dune buggies and vandalizing National Park property. It was these relatively petty crimes, not the murders, that led to the Manson family’s arrest.In December 1969, a joint force of National Park rangers, California Highway Patrol and Inyo County Sheriff’s officers burst into Barker Ranch and dragged a crazed Swastika-tattooed man out from under a bathroom vanity. At the time they thought they were nabbing a group of local troublemakers. It was only after the arrest that Manson and others at the ranch were linked to the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. The fateful arrest ultimately led to a life imprisonment for Manson.In 2008, a search of the site was conducted looking for the remains of additional Manson family victims, long rumored to have been buried by Barker Ranch. Though bullet casings were found, no new remains were uncovered and the dig was called off. In 2010, much of the wooden structure of Barker Ranch and the infamous vanity in which Manson hid himself burned down.

It was discovered that one of the walls was actually made of wattle and daub, an ancient building compound that used wooden strips held together by mud and clay. They also found some ancient coins that dated back to around 900 CE which was confirmed when the ancient wall was carbon tested. Looking into history, it seems that the bar had likely existed for over a thousand years after being established as an inn for travelers crossing the fords that once sat in the area.The coins and most of the wall were moved to the Irish National Museum, but a portion of the ancient construction still remains on site.

37,Fliegeberg,"aviation,engineering,memorials",193,830,"Berlin’s Fliegeberg (literally “Fly Mountain”) is a 15-meter-tall artificial hill erected by Otto Lilienthal, the first person to successfully make repeated, well-documented flights in heavier-than-air gliders. The hill now stands in the middle of a park named after him, built as a memorial to the flight pioneer.Lilienthal was born in the town of Anklam, in the Prussian province of Pomerania in 1848. He was fascinated by the flight of birds, to the point of building sets of artificial wings with the help of his brother, Gustav. There is no evidence of these early flying machines working, but they set Otto on a path that would eventually put flight in human hands.He began working as an engineer, and would later go on to found his own machine company, producing steam engines. However, he never stopped doing research into the flight of birds — storks in particular — and continued to test gliders of his own design. His first public test was in 1891, at the Windmühlenberg (“Windmill Mountain”) near Potsdam. Over the course of the next several years, he conducted tests at several locations, until, in 1894, he built the Fliegeberg near his home in Lichterfelde, now a part of Berlin. His tests here would often draw crowds, and the flat land surrounding the hill allowed the tests to be photographed. As word of his flights spread across the world, he became known as the “Glider King.”Otto Lilienthal’s last flight occurred on August 9, 1896. He was testing a new glider design in the hills near the town of Rhinow, a place where he had conducted tests previously. During the flight, Lilienthal tried to lower the glider, but pitched too far forward, and found himself pointing directly downwards. Despite his best efforts, Lilienthal could not regain control; both he and the glider fell headlong to the earth from a height of 15 meters, breaking Lilienthal’s neck. He died the next day.At the time of Lilienthal’s death, he had patented 25 glider designs, which would go on to inspire other early flyers, including the Wright Brothers.His testing ground became Lilienthalpark in 1900, and in 1932, a monument to Lilienthal’s memory was built at the Fliegeberg’s peak. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Gustav Lilienthal and Paul Beylich, who was one of Otto’s main assistants (both are honored with small concrete plaques at the base of the hill). The monument was designed by the architect Fritz Freymüller, and takes the form of a bronze globe surrounded by a circular pavilion that is open in the middle, leaving the globe exposed to the sky.The original globe was melted down during World War II and was eventually replaced in 1990 (after having been replaced by a stone sphere in 1955).

38,Marché Jean-Talon,"markets,food",897,830,"Fresh, local food, original and delicious, smiling faces of Quebec farmers, snack kiosks from crepes to baklava, fair-trade coffee, homemade pasta, giant mushrooms, prize-worthy cheese. These are just some of the things that come to mind when thinking about Montreal’s Jean-Talon Market.This open-air market, which has served the city since 1933, is located in the geographical center of the island of Montreal in the “Little Italy” district. It has 150-plus vendors and covers over almost 220,000 square feet. In the summer the vendor numbers double, most coming in from farms in the surrounding areas of the city. In true Montreal form, the market braves the city’s harsh winters and is open year-long. In the summer there is fresh seafood from Quebec’s Gaspesie region and strawberries from a number of local farms. Spring boasts all things maple, and the market has endless stalls selling maple any and every which way anyone could hope for. There are rows of treats in endless maple combinations like maple candy, maple fudge, maple butter, and the classic, maple syrup. There’s sometimes “tire d’erable” (maple taffy) ready to sample, every Canadian’s favorite winter snack. During the harvest time there’s squash and pumpkins aplenty, Quebec cranberries and fresh cranberry and apple juice ready for purchase or to go. There’s a kiosk with more different types of mushrooms than you knew existed, close to 30. After you’ve browsed through the middle of the market, hands occupied with bags filled with fresh produce, head to the edges of the market to its many unique shops. There are specialty shops for fish (or “poissonneries”), prize-winning meats and cheeses, spices, bakeries, and pasta. There is much to browse, sample, and buy. Jean-Talon Market doesn’t miss a thing when it comes to food.In the middle of a busy city day, the market is always there and the farmers are waiting for you to sample a fresh tomato slice and take home a $2 bag before heading to the spice store to buy Moroccan mint and authentic Jamaican jerk spice from the experts. Then sit in the middle of the market and enjoy a crepe and a cup of coffee. Across from some of the best Turkish Delights you will find outside of Turkey, there is an amazing bakery stand that has wonderful Québécois desserts, such as pet de soeurs and maple pie.","Montreal's giant farmer's market is a foodie's best friend, especially in the winter months. ","Twilight Sculpture Garden,La Sala Rossa,Our Lady of La Difesa","7070 Avenue Henri-Julien Montreal, Québec, H2S 3S3 Canada",45.5365,-73.6147,Jennifer RichardsonJFishRachelmaristoddardsandlinpreecsMartinsandlinpreecsmmaristoddardkathrynkefmfbullinsKKaddyshackJFishnnickelcurryMMartinRachel,2013-02-10 00:00:00,"Our Lady of La Difesa,Twilight Sculpture Garden,La Sala Rossa,The Murals on Saint Laurent Boulevard","Portland Mercado,La Nueva Viga Market,Teitel Brothers,Cafe al Mercato",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/marche-jean-talon
39,The Avrocar ,"retro-tech,inventions",387,830,"The year was 1952 and the Cold War was in full chill. The House Un-American Activities Committee was looking for “reds under beds,” while teenage boys read science fiction comics and watched movies like “The Day The Earth Stood Still.”As both communist paranoia and the sci-fi craze swept the nation, UFO sightings were spreading like an epidemic across the United States. Even Air Force pilots reported being pursued by flying saucers. They may not all have been so crazy after all.Enter the Avro Canada VZ-9. The Avrocar was a VTOL – vertical take off and landing – aircraft developed in Canada by Avro Aircraft Ltd. as part of a secret U.S. military project carried out in the early years of the Cold War.The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect – “the tendency of a fluid jet to be attracted to a nearby surface” – to provide lift and thrust in the form of a single “turbo rotor” blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft, sort of like a hovercraft on speed. The vehicle was meant to manned by a crew of two, in separate cockpits, and the army planned on utilizing the craft as a sort of “flying jeep.”In the air, the Avrocar distinctly resembled a flying saucer. Two prototypes were built as “proof-of-concept” test vehicles, before building a more advanced USAF fighter. However, In flight-testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems. The saucer proved immensely difficult to fly with very sensitive controls, and one pilot likened flying it to “balancing on a beach ball.” Though the Avrocar was made to fly up to 190 km/h and it was believed with some modifications the project was salvageable, funding ran out and the project was canceled in September 1961.The first Avrocar eventually became a “wind tunnel” test model at NASA until 1966, when it was donated to the National Air and Space Museum, in Suitland, Maryland where it mostly gathered dust and began to fall apart.Scheduled for restoration and display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center the Avrocar has been loaned to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.If you can’t get down to Ohio to see the real deal you can see a full-scale replica of the Avrocar at the Western Canada Aviation Museum, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The reproduction was prepared for the 2002 TV production, Avrocar: Saucer Secrets from the Past.

The main falls drop 60 feet into a scenic canyon that is littered with the debris of several small trees; in 2012, an F-3 tornado hit the area and the debris can still be found to this day. In the early 1960s, Broke Falls, located near the small town of Wellington, was a State Park that was immensely popular with visitors. But when the new Mountain Parkway road opened, traffic flow was cut and the park was soon abandoned by the state. The land was given to private owners in the 1980s. It was practically abandoned until 2002, when Menifee County bought it back and began maintaining it. One year after a celebration of the park’s restoration, a major tornado barreled through the park and altered the scenery wildly. Even though cleanup has been made for visitors to see the main falls, most trails are still blocked; this leads to creepy sites such as an abandoned walking bridge over the creek, with no access, and a barrage of fallen trees. The park has decided not to remove more debris in order to let natural restoration happen, and thus the scars of the natural event remain to this day.

After lying dormant for the better part of the 20th century, the cave was put into service by Clemson University as a blue cheese growing habitat thanks to the cave’s stable 50 degree temperature.Currently the almost 1,700 feet of unused tunnel is maintained as a public park and visitors are welcome to explore the shallow mountain incursion, however there are bats living in the cave which may send explorers running from the site just like the rail workers of yore. ",An unfinished rail tunnel that has since been used to house cheese and bats. ,"Oconee Station State Historic Site,Cemetery Island,""Eye of God"" Rapid, Chattooga River","Stumphouse Tunnel Park Walhalla, South Carolina, 29691 United States",34.7648,-83.064,briangaineslittlebrumbleAnnetta BlackRacheljaronlogginscamcobb02ccamcobb02jjacob29687michaelamillerjjaronlogginsRachelAnnetta Blacklittlebrumble,2013-09-24 00:00:00,"Oconee Station State Historic Site,""Eye of God"" Rapid, Chattooga River,Cemetery Island,Grimshawes Post Office","Old Tunnel Bat Colony,Ryūsendō Cave,Sudwala Caves,Beer Quarry Caves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stumphouse-tunnel

43,Vasa Museum,"shipwrecks,ships,ruins,museums",1816,828,"Seventeenth-century Sweden was an up-and-coming state with great ambitions. Colonial expansion was on the mind of every royal, and for Sweden, the Navy was to be the backbone of any successful grand strategy. A ship called Vasa was built as the flagship of the new Swedish navy. King Gustavus Adolphus himself commissioned the ship.The ship was to be a giant floating fortress. The combined weight of the ammunition fired from one side of the boat was 588 pounds, making it the most well-armed ship to date. The Vasa’s armament included 48 light cannons, two additional large cannons of an older design, eight “three-pounders,” and six large howitzers for use during boarding action. All this heavy firepower was crammed onto both the ship’s lower and upper floors, making for a somewhat top-heavy design. Construction problems were evident from the beginning, and early stability tests showed the ship was in constant danger of capsizing. Nonetheless, under pressure from the royal court, the ship was completed on a very tight schedule.On August 10, 1628, the Vasa was deemed complete and launched on its maiden voyage. It managed to sail for a little less than one nautical mile. A gust of wind made it keel to its port side and water started pouring through the open gun ports onto its lower deck. The ship sank in matter of minutes, in full view of a crowd that had gathered to witness the launching, including foreign ambassadors and royal officials. The loss of the Vasa was a blow to both the prestige of Sweden and its economy—one from which its navy never fully recovered.Though the Swedish court looked long and hard for a guilty party, none were found, and the official investigator, upon being asked the cause of the sinking, replied “only God knows.”As the ship sank in only 32 meters of water, several early salvage attempts were made, all of them unsuccessful. The ship’s location was eventually lost to history, until it was relocated in the 1950s under the efforts of amateur archaeologist Anders Franzén. Vasa was lifted to the surface in April of 1961 after being underwater for some 333 years. Thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the hull of the the Vasa. (Ironically it was the heavy pollution of the Swedish bay that killed wood-eating microorganisms and helped preserve the ship.) The Vasa Museum was opened in 1990 to permanently house the remains of the ship. ",It houses the remains of a 17th-century version of the Titanic. ,"Skansen Open Air Museum,Vikingaliv Runestone,Kastellet Stockholm","Galärvarvsvägen 14  Stockholm, 11521 Sweden",59.328,18.0914,stanestanegwenleifJoeBenSimoCoolCrabSkareMediaendelXavixavirKKristjanKJoeBenSimoCoolCrabhrnickgwenleifSkareMediaeendelmmbisonSeth Teicherlittlebrumble,2009-07-13 00:00:00,"Vikingaliv Runestone,Kastellet Stockholm,Skansen Open Air Museum,'The Battle of Gotland 1361' Exhibit","Wyoming Sculpture,Albaola Itsas Kultur Faktoria,Whydah Pirate Museum,Nantucket Shipwreck & Lifesaving Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vasa-museum

Look down, and you’ll likely find some tethered to one of the antique horse rings scattered throughout the sidewalks.Scott Wayne Indiana, a Portland resident, began tethering toy steeds to the horse rings in 2005. His quirky personal art project soon took off. Before long, other Portland residents were adding their own tiny horses to the herd. Now, many of the city’s horse rings have plastic ponies attached to them.Locals have long been tethering toy horses to the rings scattered throughout the city. The trend shot off at a gallop after Indiana’s Portland Horse Project gained traction. More than a decade since Indiana’s first toy horses descended upon the streets, people still have yet to rein in their enthusiasm for the project. People leave treats, tack, hay, and riders for the little equines (and their occasional dinosaur friends). One Portland couple even got engaged after meeting because of one of the horses.In addition to adding a fun touch of equine whimsy to the streets, the Portland Horse Project also preserves an often overlooked part of the city’s heritage. The horse rings date to the 19th and early 20th centuries and hark back to a time when horse-drawn carriages were the main method of transportation.Over time, Portland began losing these small relics of its horsey history as construction tore up its streets and sidewalks.

Since that day, UCLA’s collection has grown to number over 2400 samples strong, taken from more than 1,500 separate carelessly careening space objects. Together they form what is known as the UCLA Meteorite Collection: a publicly displayed, scientifically curated house of wonder, rare in its balance of scientific precision and public accessibility.On display are 40 “main masses,” the most hulking hunks of the bunch, and about 300 smaller chunks typifying the varieties of specimens that exist floating around in the dark ether, just waiting to rain down on us at any moment. The rest of the collection’s thousands of meteorites are either bits that are better suited for scientific study, or have been loaned out to other institutions of intellectual or scientific merit — including to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History.In commemoration of such a monumental gesture of genesis, the folks in charge at UCLA’s Meteorite Collection went so far as to rename the very first piece of the collection — that big piece of the Canyon Diablo meteorite donated by Clark—after the man himself.

But beware: If you get too shallow (like three feet of water or so), the pigs can—and probably will—jump into your boat and look for your lunch. But that’s only if they’re feeling especially friendly.The pigs control the island, roaming on their own terms, but they prefer to stay in the shade during the sunny hours, venturing onto the beach and into the waters when it cools down a bit. It’s unclear how the pigs got there, some believing they survived a shipwreck, others say that sailors left them there for a future meal and never returned. Recently, up to 10 of the Bahamas’ swimming pigs were found dead. Though initial reports suggested that tourists had given the pigs fatal doses of alcohol, Humane Society inspector Ventoi Bethune told National Geographic that the dead swine had likely ingested sand. Another theory was that this was brought about by the unusually dry January. Veterinarians who visited the site found large quantities of sand in the deceased animals’ stomachs, which Bethune says may have been caused by a recent influx of visitors throwing small amounts of food on the beach.","In paradise, feral pigs have claimed an island all to themselves.  ","Nurse Sharks of Compass Cay,The Musician,Cape Eleuthera Resort Ruins","Big Major Cay Bahamas 24.1836, -76.4564NearbyNurse Sharks of Compass Cay6.43 milesThe Musician25.79 milesCape Eleuthera Resort Ruins45.39 miles",24.1836,-76.4564,brettyoungNicholas Jacksonrc6750aribrownjlc03vTeaAndCoffeeLoverTeaAndCoffeeLoverPatti NevesaaribrownPericles Rosarc6750jjlc03vNicholas Jackson,2011-06-01 00:00:00,"Nurse Sharks of Compass Cay,The Musician,Cape Eleuthera Resort Ruins,Underwater Plane Wreck Near Staniel Cay","Crabs of Christmas Island,Monkey Island,Keahole Point Blowhole,Bass Rock ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swimming-pigs-of-big-major-cay

They resemble catacombs and consist of 26 shrines and dioramas along a .2 mile tunnel. These caves were built not by nature, but by one Father Philip Wagner.In 1912, early in his seminary career, he traveled to Lourdes, France to visit the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. He asked for a return to health so that he could make it through the ordination process. If this prayer was fulfilled, he would build another shrine to Our Lady.Wagner’s prayer was answered—he became a priest, and was stationed in Rudolph, Wisconsin. Despite the fact that he didn’t know the first thing about construction, he began work on a new chapel, more central to the townspeople, and of course, the shrine he promised. Work continued until 1983, carried on by Father Wagner, his successors, and various inspired volunteers.The shrines depict the Stations of the Cross and the Seven Sorrows of Mary, but there are also several secular displays of rural life.

53,The Dove,"rivals week,printing,lost wonders,literature,found",302,827,"“I must, before I die, create the type for ‘Beautiful Book’ and actualise it, writing, printing, ornament and binding. I will learn to write, to print and to decorate,” wrote Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson of his life’s mission as bookbinder and font designer. Little did he know the legacy he was destined to leave, and that the only thing left standing would be a pub.When Cobden-Sanderson established his first bindery in 1893 in London’s Hammersmith neighborhood, it made perfect sense that he would tip his hat to the local haunt of literary giants sitting just around the corner: The Dove public house. Founded in the early- to mid-18th century, the tavern had already housed a generous cross-section of writers and creatives by the time Cobden-Sanderson paid his tribute. Poet James Thomson is said to have composed his “Rule Britannia” under its eaves in 1740, and A.P. Herbert went on to immortalize the pub itself within his pages under the guise of “The Pigeon” in 1930.Though the pub was added to England’s National Heritage List in June of 1954, the Dove has operated with few changes for centuries. To this day, the Dove’s doors remain open to one and all.Meanwhile, Coburn-Sanderson’s inextricably linked Dove Bindery couldn’t have taken a more opposing tack from the pub after which it was named. In 1901 the bookbinder expanded his business in the form of a joint venture with Emery Walker. Together they opened Doves Press, located just around the corner from the Dove tavern.The venture proved hugely successful; their five volume “English Bible” made the press a large profit. These “Doves Bibles” are still immensely valuable and can fetch over $45,000 when sold today. Over time, however, the two men’s personal and professional relationship broke down. They finally severed their partnership in 1909, agreeing that Walker would have ownership of the business after Cobden-Sanderson’s death.Increasingly erratic, Cobden-Sanderson declared that Walker would never have access to the press’ renowned typeface and began clandestinely “bequeathing” Doves Type to the River Thames. By 1916 he had slowly but surely thrown more than a ton (or 2,600 pounds) of the typeface, bundled into individual 12-pound paper parcels off the side of the nearby Hammersmith Bridge.Out of vindictiveness to his former partner, the world had also been forced to give up Doves Type for lost, for if Cobden-Sanderson couldn’t use it, he determined no one else would either. Or so the story went until November 2014, when 150 pieces of the original typeface were salvaged from the Thames by a very determined designer named Robert Green. A digital facsimile of the font is now available, which can be best perused while sipping on a pint at the Dove, gazing toward the Hammersmith Bridge, and chuckling about the immortal—almost spiteful—nature of all truly great work.",A glorious pub known for a spiteful printing feud and its famous typeface lost—then found—at the bottom of the Thames. ,"WWT London Wetland Centre,Leg o' Mutton Reservoir and Park,36 Blythe Road","19 Upper Mall London, England, W6 9TA United Kingdom",51.4905,-0.2348,paulypaulSEANETTAmawawi9806reyhanCollector of Experienceslittlebrumble,2016-08-08 00:00:00,"Leg o' Mutton Reservoir and Park,WWT London Wetland Centre,36 Blythe Road,Horizon Insects ","Denver Zine Library,REI's Wall of Litho Stones,The Reichenbach Falls,‘Fantasy Swan’",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dove-london-england

The collection contains works that appear to be from such art world luminaries as Klimt, Rembrandt, and Matisse, but were in fact created by the hand of some enterprising forger.Rather than condemning the practice, the museum celebrates the artistry of the forgery, being careful to distinguish different types of fakery. As their website describes it, there is forgery in the style of another painter, where a forger tries to create something they can pass off as a new work from a famous name; there is the identical forgery that is created to exactly replicate a pre-existing work; and there are copies, which are identical works created at least 70 years after the death of the original painter and sold as replicas. The collection also highlights a few notable forgers including Tom Keating who claims to have forged over 2,000 works as a statement against the corruption of the gallery scene, planting “time-bombs” in his replicas that could be discovered later, invalidating the forgeries to any duped collector. Of course, even these forgeries are now valuable. The museum also displays a number of forged diary pages purported to have been written by Adolf Hitler.Faking something well is no easy feat.

What looks like the scrawl of a passing vandal is actually the work of historic sculptor Michelangelo. However, despite the author’s fame there are numerous stories surrounding the origin of this little piece of graffiti. One theory states that Michelangelo carved the face on a dare and even etched it in the stone with his back-turned. Others say that the artist was regularly caught in conversation with a notorious bore and one day carved the chatty man’s likeness into the wall simply to pass the time. Still another version of the story states that Michelangelo witnessed an execution in the square and the face is that of the man on death row. No one is quite sure exactly why Michelangelo decided upon this bit of civil disobedience, but its very existence provides a bit of insight to the human side of an artist who is most often thought of as a stodgy classicist.    ",The famous sculptor left his mark on this Italian wall in an internationally protected example of street art. ,"Medici Hall of Maps (Sala delle Carte Geografiche) ,Studiolo Francesco I de’ Medici,Il Porcellino ","Piazza della Signoria Florence, 50122 Italy",43.7697,11.2556,kiddevilspadaadjustingsharondee98Julius SpadatheannagreenCollector of Experiences,2014-04-28 00:00:00,"Studiolo Francesco I de’ Medici,Medici Hall of Maps (Sala delle Carte Geografiche) ,Il Porcellino ,Dante's Dagger","Pedvale Open Air Art Museum,‘Fantasy Swan’,Virtuoso Sculpture,'Bouquet of Tulips'",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/l-importuno-di-michelangelo

57,Zzyzx Mineral Springs and Healing Center,"hoaxes and pseudoscience,places to stay,outsider architecture,water",282,1027,"Curtis Howe Springer was a self-proclaimed medical doctor and Methodist minister, though in actuality he was licensed to do neither. He was, however, a popular radio evangelist in Pittsburgh in the 1930s, and the founder of Zzyzx Mineral Springs and Healing Center out in the Mojave desert of California.Like many other hucksters of his day, Springer convinced his devoted followers to move out to the West Coast, where he promised a new, utopian way of living and an abundance of miracle cures. At the time, the West Coast had a slight reputation for its questionable businessmen, who built empires out of cheap land, religious fads, and get-rich-quick schemes. Springer was no different, having founded or managed six other failed resorts before striking it rich with Zzyzx.In 1944, Springer, along with his fiancee Helen and their daughter, stumbled upon a “mosquito swamp” in the east Mojave. It was there, in the middle of the desert, where Springer envisioned his utopia. Not surprisingly, he acquired the land by filing a dubious mining claim for 12,000 acres. For the next few months, Springer split his time between the desert and Los Angeles, where he taped radio broadcasts and recruited builders.To find his artisans, Springer bought a large bus and drove down to Skid Row, where he rounded up vagrants and offered them meals and shelter in exchange for construction. Some of the men left when learning of the “no alcohol” policy, but many stayed. Together, the men built a two-story hotel, an artificial lake, a cross-shaped pool and even an airstrip, which Springer named Zyport. Some of the builders stayed in the strange utopia for years, others, for the rest of their lives.Springer advertised the Zzyzx Mineral Springs and Health Resort on his syndicated religious radio show, and asked his listeners for “donations” for his special miracle cures. The potions, though only comprised of basic vegetables like celery and carrots, were marketed as the cure for everything from hemorrhoids to cancer. Guests at the resort were able to try Springer’s “life-prolonging” Antediluvian Tea, but his most popular remedy was an anti-baldness cream, Mo-Hair. Users were instructed to rub the potion vigorously on their scalp, then bend over and hold their breath for as long as possible. When the blood rushed to their head from lack of oxygen, Springer would cite their red faces as “proof” that his miracle potion was working its magic.Springer publicized his desert utopia as the “last word” on health and vitality, and even gave the place its name, Zzyzx (pronounced “zi-zix”), because he believed it was the last word in the English language. For the next 30 years, hundreds of visitors came to his resort in search of a healthier lifestyle, but Springer’s dubious business practices would eventually catch up to him. Springer, in yet another hare-brained scheme, tried selling the plots adjacent to Zzyzx, despite never having purchased them himself. This act, along with lawsuits from bald men who Mo-Hair failed to cure, eventually brought government attention to the site, and Springer and his followers were evicted in 1974.In 1984, Zzyzx was finally entered as a geographical name, and today, California State University runs its Desert Studies Center from the site. Though the center is used mostly by biology students and researchers, curious “desert-oriented” groups can plan an overnight stay, where dorm-style accommodations are available in the old resort.Update as of May 2021: The area is currently closed to the public, review the National Park Service website before going. ",A former utopian healing center created by a huckster and built by derelicts.  ,"Alien Fresh Jerky,Travelers Monument,World's Largest Thermometer","Zzyzx Road San Bernardino, California United States",35.1431,-116.1042,anhieaaronrwilliams1987obleuiiisAvoiding RegretLampshade1660mbisonobleuiiismmoonshaeLampshade1660aaaronrwilliams1987issargtttvpoustijondi letnapSSoCalMomof2bbentauraiitsmebrandiAvoiding Regretmmbison,2009-10-19 00:00:00,"Travelers Monument,World's Largest Thermometer,Alien Fresh Jerky,Mojave Megaphone","UFO Watchtower,American Society of Dowsers ,The Lookout-Rubha Hunish ,Sompasauna",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zzyzx-mineral-springs-and-healing-center

He needed a place to make his music that was just as big, just as expansive as his work, and he had one: Paisley Park.The 65,000-square-foot building in Chanhassen, Minnesota served as a recording and production studio as well as private residence for the musician. And shortly after the singer’s death in 2016, Paisley Park was opened to the public.Visitors can now see the complex where Prince recorded several of his albums, and artists including James Brown, Neil Young, and Madonna came to record as well. Also on view are memorabilia from the artist including instruments, artwork, motorcycles, and rare recordings. And, oh yeah, the actual sounds of doves crying.Prince envisioned Paisley Park, built in 1987, as a place that wouldn’t just enable him to produce his musical work, but be a creative space for film and commercial productions, performance, and clothing production. So what should fans of the late performer making the trek to the Minneapolis suburb expect?Well, for starters, as you enter you’ll hear the sounds of Majesty and Divinity, Prince’s pet doves. You’ll see an urn, shaped like Paisley Park and decorated with white doves, crystals, and a replica of his purple piano. And yes, that urn contains the singer’s ashes. Depending on the level of access you choose on the tour, you can also enjoy a vegetarian meal at the end.Although close to Minneapolis, a city whose musical culture was influenced by Prince, Paisley Park wasn’t as much a part of that city’s musical scene as you would think. “If someone wants action and an exciting, dynamic night life, they are probably going to be disappointed,” studio manager John Dressell told the New York Times three years after the complex’s opening. “For people who are serious about making records, this is a great place to come.”The complex has been host to concert rehearsals from artists as diverse as Kool and the Gang and Barry Manilow. Albums by R.E.M., Stone Temple Pilots, Mavis Staples, and George Clinton were produced or recorded (at least in part) in the Paisley Park studios. At one point, the amount of production work being done at the complex lead to the Minneapolis region being ranked fourth in “film and video production revenues, behind Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.”With the musician’s death, there’s little chance of recapturing the exact feeling that must have pulsed through the building at its peak. But the museum offers a glimpse into his life, and an opportunity to remember his musical legacy.",Find out what it sounds like when doves cry at Prince's recording studio estate turned museum. ,"Southdale Center Shopping Mall,The Steamboat Minnehaha,Big Stone Mini Golf","7801 Audubon Road Chanhassen, Minnesota United States",44.8617,-93.5606,Ashawntablyell13Kristenhibbibieliahhorton07,2017-11-09 00:00:00,"The Steamboat Minnehaha,Big Stone Mini Golf,Southdale Center Shopping Mall,Pavek Museum","Fonoteca Nacional,Museum of Sound,Estey Organ Museum,The Church Studio",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paisley-park

In 1858, at one such iron mine, African-American slaves removed odd, unfamiliar objects from the ground. Geologist Philip Thomas Tyson collected the objects and brought them to the Maryland Academy of Sciences in 1859 where they were identified as the teeth of Astrodon johnstoni, later designated as Maryland’s official state dinosaur.During the Cretaceous period, between approximately 79 million and 145 million years ago, the climate of what is now the mid-Atlantic region of the United States was close to what the gulf coast of Louisiana is today. The region was dense with bayous, marshes, and meandering rivers and covered with rich vegetation.The herbivore dinosaur Astrodon johnstoni, measuring up to 60 feet long and 30 feet tall and weighing up to 20 tons, thrived in these swampy conditions, living alongside turtles, crocodiles, sharks, early mammals, and, of course, other species of dinosaur. When one of these creatures died, they occasionally sunk down and were buried in the muck, slowly turning into fossils.In the decades after the Astrodon discovery, hundreds of fossils surfaced as the area was excavated by an iron mining operation. The spot was found to be especially dense with fossils of dinosaur eggs and baby dinosaurs, which has been particularly useful to scientists piecing together the life cycle and development of dinosaur species. Paleontologists Charles Gilmore and Arthur Bibbins combed over the site in the 1890s, collecting fossils to add to museums at the Smithsonian Institution. In the late 1800s, however, the iron industry in the region faded away and without their excavations fossil collecting slowed, but never entirely ceased.In 1991, a local family found a 6-foot-long Astrodon femur on the site, the largest bone ever uncovered there. In 2009, 41 acres were set aside as Dinosaur Park, with 7.5 acres open to the public. Paleontologists allow natural erosion from wind and rain to slowly uncover deeper layers and then comb the surface of the site for any fossils. Twice per month, on every first and third Saturday, the public is allowed in to assist paleontologists in gathering fossils. Everything collected at the site is sent to the Smithsonian for identification and storage, and if an object you uncover is ever displayed, your name will be there next to it as its finder.",This dig site outside D.C. is known for its exceptionally high density of baby dinosaur fossils and dinosaur eggs. ,"Smokey Bear Archive,Pinball Parlor at MOM's Organic Market,On the Brink","13100 Mid Atlantic Blvd Laurel, Maryland United States",39.0708,-76.8686,WhiskeyBristlesannakovachickaimpkristingail,2017-06-05 00:00:00,"Smokey Bear Archive,Pinball Parlor at MOM's Organic Market,On the Brink,Greenbelt Historic District","Capitalsaurus Court,Enciso Ichnites,Castilla-La Mancha Paleontological Museum,Powder Hill Dinosaur Park",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laurel-dinosaur-park

Male mammoths that is. After stumbling on what would prove to be a giant tooth, the site father-son duo were able to excavate a full skull and that was just the beginning. Once an actual paleontology team took over the site, a seemingly endless treasure trove of bones and fossils became coming out of the ground. While there were the remains of giant bears and tremendous plants the overwhelming number of bones belonged to mammoths with one odd characteristic, they all seemed to be male. It is believed that if mammoth behavior is anything like modern pachyderm activity, they would have lived in a matriarchy where males are occasionally expelled from the group and are left to wander alone. This isolated existence may have led the shunned mammoths to stray towards the sinkhole which, once they fell in, they could not escape from. Remains from at least 60 separate (Columbian) mammoths have been found in the excavation pit so far, in addition to remains from 3 wooly mammoths. This is the first time the two species have ever been found at the same site, which may have seen beasts lumbering to death from the far north and the deep south. A museum and research center has been built around the dig and most of the large bones have been left “in situ” in the rocks in which they were found. Visitors can actually enter the dug-out sinkhole and see the work.

You’ll come across bird nests so large they’d dwarf even dragon eggs and round circles woven from sticks that look like portals into another world. This tree art, built from twigs and branches, adds to the forest’s enchanted feel. It brings a touch of mystical whimsy to a woodland originally planted for practical purposes.The trees were planted in the 1930s as part of a revegetation program. Arranged in a grid formation, it was hoped they could help control the weeds that had begun to thrive in the previously cleared land. Later, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works used the woodland to study forest hydrology.Though their studies have since ended, the Redwood Forest still attracts its share of experiments, though these are more artistic in nature. It’s common to find the work of artist David Digapony scattered throughout the trees. His creations, which he makes by weaving together fallen branches, bring a bit of unexpected enchantment to the otherwise orderly forest.",Woven tree art gives this towering Australian woodland a touch of mystical whimsy. ,"Noojee Trestle Bridge,Kurth Kiln,Bruno’s Art and Sculpture Garden",Cement Creek Rd East Warburton Australia,-37.7198,145.7524,GavinerjefferyfkennardMadelyn Winter,2018-01-16 00:00:00,"Bruno’s Art and Sculpture Garden,Kurth Kiln,Noojee Trestle Bridge,William Ricketts Sanctuary","Fragas do Eume,Trollskogen (The Troll Forest),Thain Family Forest,Tambopata Research Center",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/redwood-forest-tree-art

But don’t just pass blindly by the 40-foot-long stainless steel wave in front of a nonprofit office—it hides a musical secret.When pedestrians wave their hands beneath the sculpture’s glowing LED lights, each one produces a distinct musical tone. The “strings” can be “plucked” individually, or “strummed” so they resonate together. The light sensors pulse purple, blue, red, green, and white, producing a unique sound with each different color. This is the work of artist Jen Lewin, who is known for her interactive installations. For Lewin, the community is complicit in creating the artwork as they participate in it. Some seek out the sidewalk harp, while others stumble upon it in surprise when their hands accidentally brush the sensors.

Tucked away behind a 12th century church in the picturesque village of Duddingston, the green hideaway sits in the shadow of an extinct volcano and overlooks a loch.On a sunny day, the scene from the garden is simply stunning, boasting gorgeous views across the sparkling water and to the hills beyond. This being Edinburgh, with its famously changeable weather, there may well be a cloudy sky above. But the space itself provides a constant: a place of peace.The garden, at the foot of Arthur’s Seat (a hill and extinct volcano popular with walkers) was landscaped out of uncultivated wilderness land in the 1960s by the late Nancy and Andrew Neil, both doctors in the city. Their patients had the opportunity to help out in the garden, with the fresh air, physical activity, and picturesque setting acting as their own kind of remedies.Two features of particular interest are the physic garden, which grows medicinal plants, and Thomson’s Tower. It was constructed in 1825 along with much of Edinburgh’s New Town. The tower was originally built for the Duddingston Curling Society, back when frozen lochs were the grounds for curling and other winter sports.In the early 19th century Reverend John Thomson was the minister of the nearby Duddingston Kirk and a reputable landscape painter as well. The tower had fallen out of use by the curling team, so Thomson repurposed it as his studio. Over the years he hosted many notable landscape artists including Henry Raeburn and J.M.W. Turner, who used the tower’s vantage point to paint the loch.These days the garden is run and maintained by volunteers. Depending on the time of year, snowdrops, rhododendrons, and azaleas add a splash of colour, and there’s always the possibility of spotting heron and the occasional kingfisher or bittern. The peaceful setting and beautiful plant life draws artists, writers, and meditators. ",A secret garden in a picturesque Edinburgh village has inspired artists for centuries. ,"Sheep Heid Inn,Huang Kuan Statue,Jougs Collar of Duddingston Kirk","5 Old Church Ln Edinburgh, Scotland, EH15 United Kingdom",55.9406,-3.149,ScottishRosereley250SEANETTAlinkogeckohrnickMolly McBride Jacobsonjooniurlinkogeckoreley250SEANETTAMolly McBride Jacobsonhrnick,2017-03-31 00:00:00,"Jougs Collar of Duddingston Kirk,Sheep Heid Inn,Huang Kuan Statue,Innocent Railway Path","Kelleher Rose Garden,Kemptown Secret Garden,Dunbar's Close,Ash Dome",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dr-neils-garden

71,Heidelberg Project,"racism,cars,black history,outsider architecture,eccentric homes,outsider art,homes",991,827,"Tyree Guyton grew up in a Detroit that was a thriving city, and his house was in a growing, middle-class neighborhood. But in 1967, when Guyton was 12, he witnessed the destructive effects of the 1967 Detroit riots, the result of social unrest over discrimination sparked by a police raid on a bar which left 43 dead and 467 injured.When Guyton returned to the neighborhood as an adult after serving in the Army, things had only gotten worse. In his words, his neighborhood, and Detroit in general, looked as if “a bomb went off.”Started in 1986, Guyton’s Heidelberg Project was his attempt to reclaim an area that had become so run-down and unsafe that people were afraid to walk through the area, even during the day time. Using paint, refuse from the neighborhood, and a small army of local kids, Guyton began transforming abandoned houses into massive works of art.It has been a difficult road. Despite the project’s having been featured everywhere from Oprah to the Today Show and considered a Detroit landmark, it was twice demolished by the city, in 1991 and 1999. Guyton, however, was undaunted and simply began anew each time. Eventually, the Wayne County Circuit Court ruled that the Heidelberg Project was protected under the First Amendment.The project occupies the entire block and is made up of more than 20 individual art projects. Among the most significant are the “Dotty Wotty House,” “Noah’s Ark,” and “Faces in the Hood,” portraits painted on car hoods set into the ground. Today, the project is known throughout the world and receives over 200,000 visitors a year. It was even elected to represent the United States in the 2008 Venice Architecture Biennale.In 2009, Guyton received an honorary doctorate from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, which he attended for several years in the 1980s, before beginning the Heidelberg Project. In 2010, he was recognized by Wayne State University with a Community Leadership Award. In addition to its artistic landscape, the Heidelberg Project is an established nonprofit organization, designed to improve lives and neighborhoods through art.In 2013, part of the Heidelberg Project was burned to the ground in a fire suspected to be arson. Another fire in November of that year took down another house. By the end of the year, five houses had burned down. Additionally, questions have been raised about unpaid taxes and foreclosures on the property.  In March 2014, a sixth house was burned down. Undeterred, Guyton announced a new vision called Heidelberg 3.0 in 2016, which would shift the project from an art installation into a larger community-focused arts village. The program moved into a new campus located at Heidelberg and McDougall in 2019, and has continued expanding its community based on principles of art, equity, and diversity.Update as of October 2021: Some of the pieces have been removed. ",One man's attempt to create an artistic wonder on a run-down block in Detroit.  ,"The Dequindre Cut Greenway,The Raven Lounge,St. Joseph Oratory","3600 Block of Heidelberg Street Detroit, Michigan, 48207 United States",42.3586,-83.0215,Dylanpaulrutalyona2mbisonAnnetta Blackjarednagelmmelfacexmmarybirospaulrutambreland67eevilgreentriangleaamandahagarlyona2mmariseliseesmetravelsrrenkesslerjjarednagelmmbisonhheidelbergprojectwytheAnnetta Black,2009-10-24 00:00:00,"St. Joseph Oratory,The Raven Lounge,The Dequindre Cut Greenway,Murals in the Market ","El Nido de Quetzalcóatl,Smith Mansion,Hamtramck Disneyland,Bottle House of Ganja",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/heidelberg-project
72,Point Reyes Lighthouse,"lighthouses,film locations,film",557,824,"The extremely high winds and dense fog that descend from the Gulf of Farallones onto Point Reyes, California, necessitated a need for a lighthouse. As such, the Point Reyes Lighthouse was built in 1870. The beacon spends the majority of the year wrapped in a thick cloak of fog. The stark imagery of the lighthouse on the edge of a rocky cliff surrounded by murk and great waves crashing around it has inspired artists.The poet Weldon Kees was so moved by the Point Reyes Lighthouse that he wrote the poem “The Exposed Reef.” The poem recounts the harrowing experience of a sailor being swept away by raging waters and crashing onto the jagged rocks at the base of the lighthouse. In 1954, Kees would return to Point Reyes to collaborate with the filmmaker William Heick to make a documentary on the lighthouse. Most people today will recognize the Point Reyes Lighthouse from the cult horror film The Fog, directed by John Carpenter. In the film, Adrienne Barbeau portrays a disc jockey whose radio show broadcasts from the lighthouse. She uses her show to warn the townspeople of a supernatural fog carrying with it a crew of undead pirates.The area where the Point Reyes Lighthouse is located is now a national park. The Lighthouse Visitor Center has exhibits on maritime history as well as information on the native sea life. Weather permitting, park visitors can walk the 300 plus steps down to the lighthouse and enter inside to view the lens and gear works.Update as of April 2020: The lighthouse and its first-order Fresnel lens and clockworks were recently restored and re-opened. ","The lighthouse central to the 1980s horror classic ""The Fog"" is, in fact, located in one of the foggiest areas of the Pacific Coast.  ","KPH Maritime Radio Receiving Station,The Marconi Conference Center ,Point Reyes Boat","27000 Sir Francis Drake Blvd Inverness, California United States",37.9965,-123.0205,Andres SchiffinokittyvdeliafrrllMJPNoCal,2019-01-11 00:00:00,"KPH Maritime Radio Receiving Station,Point Reyes Boat,The Marconi Conference Center ,1906 Earthquake Fence","Rivendell,Bagdad Cafe,Gare de la Ciotat,Drvengrad",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/point-reyes-lighthouse

Known locally as “The Vat,” this glacial pothole is thought to have formed when a rock became lodged in the river bed causing a torrent of water to spiral around and carve out the underlying granite bedrock.Measuring 13 meters (42 feet) deep and 18 meters (59 feet) wide with a sediment bed estimated at up to 7 meters (23 feet), the bowl is accessed via a narrow stream passage that suddenly opens up into a natural amphitheater.The Vat has been a popular visitor attraction since the Victorian era, probably due to it’s location on Royal Deeside. Local legend has it that the Vat provided sanctuary to the famous Scottish outlaw by Rob Roy Macgregor. While this is mere myth, it has been established that it was used as a hideout from authorities by notorious bandit Patrick Gilroy Macgregor, a 17th-century cattle thief and general roustabout.The hike to the Vat also affords glimpses at a variety of flora and fauna, along with some other examples of glacial morphology.",A glacial pothole was once a hideout for a notorious Scottish outlaw. ,"Corgarff Castle,Garbh Allt Falls Bridge,'Tick Tock'","Muir of Dinnet National Nature Reserve Aberdeenshire, Scotland United Kingdom",57.0848,-2.9437,mwebb63Moun10BikeCollector of ExperiencesRHyzer,2016-11-28 00:00:00,"Corgarff Castle,Garbh Allt Falls Bridge,'Tick Tock',Cairngorm Reindeer Centre","Eastern Sub-Continental Divide Mural,Rosomača Canyon,Pertosa Caves,Unaweep Canyon",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burn-ovat
74,The Pinnacles,"rock formations,rivers,geological oddities,parks,geology",176,822,"It’s common for steep cliffs to be formed by rivers eroding their rocky edge over time. But in Boone County, Missouri, something curious happened. A mass of 300 million-year-old limestone wedged between two rivers was eroded over the years on both sides, forming a geological anomaly known as the pinnacles.The pinnacles in Missouri (not to be confused by the California national park of the same name) is a jagged, pointy rock formation standing 75 feet high and stretching 1,000 feet long. Bordered on one side by Kelley Creek and on another by Silver Fork Creek, the two streams have been slowly pinching the mass of Burlington limestone separating them, a highly reactive stone that’s dissolved by moving water. Some parts of the stone were even carved out entirely, creating little tunnel-like windows dotting the vertical rock face. The craggy peaks are now a unique and often overlooked landmark, part of the 77-acre Pinnacles Youth Park, about 15 miles north of Columbia. In many ways, this geological oddity has created a natural playground for we humans. The rocky archways, limestone boulders and carved out shelves make the site excellent for hiking and climbing. A one-mile trail starts at a break in the trees on East Pinnacles Road, where a sign informs visitors that they are following the “Cat Tail Trail to Heart Attack Hill” and ascends quickly to the first of several awesome views of the valley below. Indeed, massive flat limestone exposures provide the perfect spot to sit back in the shade and enjoy the breeze drifting through the trees. Continuing along the trail, it narrows along the edge of the peaks — in some places, it’s one foot in front of the other, making sure to keep a hand on the limestone wall. Descent is gradual and leads back to Silver Fork and the “Old Dam Crossin.” You can follow the creek farther to another interesting geological feature, a narrow formation known as Shelving Rock, which is the result of the creek undercutting the limestone, and beginning a new phase for the pinnacles.",A geological oddity formed by two rivers carving out a mass of limestone on both sides. ,"University of Missouri Columns,Blind Boone House,Neff Hall Chinese Stone Lions","850 E Pinnacles Rd Sturgeon, Missouri United States",39.1337,-92.3227,jusToddcatmom43kentpilOsagebackroadsphotogaferguson22ccatmom43Osageaaferguson22backroadsphotogkkentpilLurkerlaine,2016-06-09 00:00:00,"Blind Boone House,Neff Hall Chinese Stone Lions,University of Missouri Columns,Thomas Jefferson’s Original Tombstone","Rosomača Canyon,Sculptured Rocks,Medicine Rocks State Park,Ausable Chasm",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pinnacles-2-sturgeon-missouri

This included 1/10 scale models of such grand monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xi’an, and even a four-story version of the towering Leshan Buddha. The attention to detail in the miniature scenes was astounding with the Great Wall being built brick-by-tiny-brick and even a little imperial wedding party taking place in the Forbidden City diorama. In contrast to the other bright, loud wonderlands crowded into Orlando, Splendid China was a quiet display recalling China’s majesty.This graceful quality was the main attraction for some and the biggest issue for others. Splendid China was actually owned by an agency of the Chinese government, which led many local Floridians to decry the displays in the park as nothing more than propaganda, especially in regard to its depiction of many Tibetan and Mongolian structures. While the park was in operation it saw repeated protests and even a campaign to disallow school field trips to the park.The park also faced an issue with its own performers. When Splendid China opened it featured dozens of the best Chinese dancers, jugglers, and acrobats. However after a number of the Chinese citizens escaped the park and declared asylum in the US, the park began hiring local talent. When the park closed in 2003, it was blamed on a decline in tourism, but there may have been more political reasons. After the abrupt closure, the thieves and vandals swooped in, taking most of what wasn’t nailed down and spray-painting what was. Today many of the miniatures, damaged and desecrated, still remain, but plans are finally underway to begin dismantling the park.

76,Lemon Grove Mummies,"mummies,crime,museums and collections",199,822,"Near sunny San Diego, the small area known as Lemon Grove is famous for its Giant Lemon, a sight to behold for all roadside novelty-seekers. Also, mummies. What do you do when your earnest search for a mummy actually yields one? What if it yields two? If you are the two teenage boys who managed to find this treasure trove of mummification, you panic, and hide them in a garage. In 1966, two California boys went to Chihuahua, Mexico in search of mummies. Quite the mummy fanatics, they knew Indian tribes had once brought their dead to the cool, dry caves near Chihuahua, and considered the area prime hunting grounds for a mummy of their very own. For over a month they peeked into every nook and cranny of the caves, until their tenacity finally paid off—the boys not only found a coveted mummy, they found two.The boys gazed at their prizes, the mummified remains of a teenage girl, as well as the tinier corpse of a one-year old. Despite their determination to find them, they were now faced with the reality of having them. They couldn’t exactly carry the bodies out of the country in backpacks, and the gravity of their mothers finding out began to become a very worrisome, previously overlooked issue. So the boys did what any secret-keeping teen would—they smuggled the bodies over the border, and convinced a friend to hide them in her garage. With no real endgame in sight the boys left their macabre finds in this safe location—safe that is until their friend’s mother decided that it was time to do some spring cleaning. 14 years after being stashed away behind the garden tools and moving boxes, the girls were found.The woman who found them was understandably shaken, and naturally assumed that some sort of murder had taken place. Stolen mummies stashed there by neighbor kids isn’t exactly the first place the mind goes. The police recognized immediately that the bodies were not likely to be murder victims, but could not figure out how the two ancient cadavers found their way into this suburban family garage—the teen is thought to have died between  A.D. 1040 and 1260. While they investigated, the mummies were delivered to the San Diego Museum of Man for safe keeping. Fondly nicknamed “The Lemon Grove Girl”, the teenage mummy and her infant companion were stashed away until rightful ownership could be sorted. Eventually the police caught up with the boys, who were now grown men of course, and asked for an explanation. The men told their story, and in an ever so generous act of contrition offered to donate their mummies to the Museum of Man. The officials, eyes rolling, informed the men that due to their juvenile status when the crime was committed and the time that had passed, they were lucky that no charges would be pressed, and thanked them for the charitable offer, but the mummies were not theirs to give. The museum however was very keen on becoming the keeper of the girls, and after being granted permission by the Mexican government to retain them, included the Lemon Grove Girl in their gorgeous Ancient Egypt and Mummies exhibit. Update November 2017: The Lemon Grove Mummies are no longer on display.","Lemon Grove, California is known for its giant lemon...and mummified bodies. ","Spreckels Organ Pavilion,San Diego Museum of Us,Balboa Park Botanical Building and Lily Pond","1350 El Prado Balboa Park  San Diego, California",32.7314,-117.1519,zackofalltradeskareikacjkleverNature MacabrehanahrnickcjkleveryyrallihammarcwhitakerNature MacabrekkareikahanahrnickRachel,2013-06-18 00:00:00,"San Diego Museum of Us,Balboa Park Botanical Building and Lily Pond,Spreckels Organ Pavilion,San Diego Model Railroad Museum","Memorium Nürnberger Prozesse (Nuremberg Trials Memorial),Egyptian Museum of Turin ,Museo Arqueológico Benahoarita (Archaeological Museum Benahoarita),Queensland Police Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lemon-grove-mummies
77,Mars Bluff Crater,"atom bombs,nuclear,disaster areas,disasters,instruments of science",157,823,"It is not often spoken about, but it’s an unsettling fact that the military had some trouble keeping those precious nuclear bombs in the air during transport at wartime, as well as throughout the Cold War when the Soviet threat had everyone on their toes.Some were lost and never recovered; sometimes the aircraft carrying them would crash. On two occasions, the bombs were accidentally dropped on unsuspecting American soil. Walter Gregg knew about the willy-nilly bomb handling all too well, because he had one dropped on his house.Clearly, if a nuclear bomb had been dropped in a populated area of South Carolina and actually detonated, it would have been catastrophic, and impossible for the military to keep relatively quiet. Luckily for Gregg, his family, and the rest of Horry County, the bomb wasn’t armed with its devastating nuclear rod. Despite the absence of that major component, it was not exactly a holiday to have a Mark 6 bomb dropped on your head from 15,000 feet. In 1958, the Cold War was in paranoiac full swing, and the B-47 Stratojet flying over South Carolina that fine spring day was required to carry the nuclear weapon, because all hell could break loose at any moment. On their way to the United Kingdom to take part in “Operation Snow Flurry,” the crew was just getting comfortable for their transatlantic trip when a fault light began to glimmer, indicating that the bomb’s harness locking pin had not engaged.Navigator Captain Bruce Kulka went to investigate, and in a colossal act of carelessness combined with a disturbing lack of safety features, accidentally hit the emergency release pin as he reached around the bomb to pull himself up. The 8,500-lb. device hit the bomb bay doors, forcing them open, and, as Kulka watched in horror, screamed into the wooded rural area of Mars Bluff.Walter Gregg was enjoying the day with his family that March 11th. Mucking about in his shop with his son while his daughters and a friend played in the yard, Gregg paid no mind to the bomber flying overhead, a common sight in those days. His wife was working in the house, and Gregg’s cousin puttered about elsewhere on the property — all in all, it was a peaceful day like any other. What happened next caught his full attention, and shattered the productive buzz of contentment: a tremendous blast that seemed to come from directly above shook the ground, filling the air with smoke and dust.Gregg, stunned and with ears ringing, frantically searched through the chaos for his family, following the sounds of their screams in the smoke. Assuming the plane had crashed, his mind tried to wrap itself around the crater that now existed where his garden was just moments before, the hole stretching 75 feet across and 30 feet deep. The pieces of ground that had been where the empty void was now began crashing back to earth around him, some of them weighing hundreds of pounds.Miraculously, as the dust settled and each family member was accounted for, the Gregg family was found battered and bruised, but intact. Everyone had survived with only minor injuries. Mrs. Gregg suffered the worst of it with a gash to her head. The house and several outbuildings were destroyed, the garden pulverized, and several nearby homes were damaged by the debris, but everyone walked away, survivors of 7,600 pounds of explosives dropped directly on their heads by the U.S. Air Force.From then on, all flights were required to ensure that bombs were locked down properly before takeoff, a rule that you’d think would have been instituted before accidentally dropping a bomb on someone’s house. The military eventually paid Gregg off, giving him $54,000 with which to start over. Gregg became friends with the crew of the aircraft that accidentally blew up his property, and remained pen pals with them for many years, long after moving away from Mars Bluff.The crater is in a heavily wooded area, and is becoming harder and harder to see but can still be spotted, at least for now.","""Not too many people can say they've had a nuclear bomb dropped on them, not too many would want to."" — Walter Gregg. ","The Last Yogi Bear Honey Fried Chicken Restaurant,Blenheim Mineral Springs,Woods Bay State Park","Crater Rd.

78,Boothill Graveyard,"wild west,relics and reliquaries,memento mori,ghost towns,catacombs and crypts,graves,graveyards,gravestones,cemeteries",1184,823,"In these modern times, death is portrayed as uncommon and tragic, often hidden from daily life. Contrast that to the rollicking days of the Wild West, where gunfights and hangings were common occurrences in the town square, and it’s easy to see how a place like Boothill Graveyard would seem curious now.A rocky burying grounds atop a hill in the historic Old West town of Tombstone, Arizona, Boothill Graveyard is a looking glass through which we can see a time and place where death came casually, and even humorously. Weathered wooden signs mark the graves of about 250 men, women, and children who passed, literally, through Tombstone, mostly between 1879-1884.Although this cemetery and the town that surrounds it are now known as tourist attractions due to their authentic Old West appeal, and because the town was the site of the infamous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, an interesting aspect of the town’s history that isn’t discussed as much is the cemetery’s integregation of a variety of races and stations in life represented in the same cemetery. Cowboys, Vaqueros, Chinese immigrants, South American immigrants, miners, former slaves, business folk, soldiers, mothers, children, soiled doves, drunks, cattle ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws are all buried, side by side, in Boothill. One of the most attended funerals in Boothill’s history was actually held for “China Mary”, Sing Choy. A competent businesswoman and well liked by the community.There is also the Jewish Memorial on site that was set aside especially for Jewish Pioneers. This is interesting, because most western cemeteries of that date range will be absent of Jewish internments alltogether.Many of the graves are marked as “unknown”. Miners and drifters who’s names have been lost to time. Graves that are marked mostly tell a blunt tale of how a person came to be deceased. “MURDERED,” reads one in outraged capital letters, while another says “Found dead in his cabin with bullet wounds,” solemnly giving more detail. It’s up to the visitor to examine the distinction between terms like “Hanged” and “Legally Hanged.”But the main reason this cemetery has become the stuff of legend is its often humorous take on death. One patterned after the popular dome store novels of the 1920’s. The name Boothill, was never even used until the mid 1920’s. One grave marker famously reads “Here lies Lester Moore. 4 slugs from a .44. No Les. No More.” Others imply a certain savagery of the time, like the one indicating two women who came to murderous blows over a man, or another that marks the grave of a man who simply “died in a dispute.”Since many of the original grave markers were wooden, very few remnants have actually remained throughout the graveyard. Most of what visitors see there now are recreations of the originals for the sake of being able to be read and allowing the continuation of the historical mystique. But a few of the stone markers still stand proudly in the Sonoran Desert sun, reminding all who visit here of what once was.","A wild west cemetery in Tombstone, Arizona, provides a window into the Old West. ","Jewish Pioneers Memorial,Rose Tree Museum,St. Paul’s Episcopal Church","Boothill Graveyard 408 Arizona Hwy 80 Tombstone, Arizona, 85638",31.7199,-110.0702,Mark Caseymordred350CorpseLady84Racheldlc31723Avoiding Regretdiscovertombstonereid43andersonmmrankin1975dlc31723CorpseLady84MMartinMom0jamordred350Avoiding RegretRachel,2012-04-03 00:00:00,"Jewish Pioneers Memorial,St. Paul’s Episcopal Church,Rose Tree Museum,The Bird Cage Theater","Boot Hill Cemetery,Grave of W.

79,R1 Nuclear Reactor,"reactors,retro-tech,nuclear,inventions",150,1027,"During the post World War II race among countries to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, some risky decisions were made.Among them was the building of Sweden’s first nuclear reactor, Reaktor 1, or R1, buried 25 meters directly underneath the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and within a 1 km of about 40,000 people. Nonetheless, in the heady days of the Cold War and nuclear armament it was deemed a tolerable risk for the scientists at KTH to be able to study reactions.Attempting to “make something with neutrons,” scientists brought the reactor online and on July 13, 1954, the reactor produced Sweden’s first nuclear reaction.R1 continued to be used for most of Sweden’s nuclear research until the 1970s, when the concern over the reactor proximity to Stockholm led to its closure.The reactor hall has since been opened to visitors and as of April 2007 the reactor hall can be visited from the KTH Museum of Science and Technology. The reactor is now a popular venue for modern art and dance performances.Update April 2017: The reactor is generally only open to visitors a couple of times per year, in conjunction with events, and is currently not open to the public at all while working with infrastructure.Update October 2018: The reactor is open once more!

80,Loretto Chapel,"stairs,sacred spaces,architectural oddities,architecture",1616,824,"The story goes something like this: Our Lady of Light Chapel was built for the Sisters of Loretto in Santa Fe, New Mexico, beginning in 1872, but the Bishop in charge died of pneumonia in 1888, before he could finish it.One of the most important elements left unfinished in the Gothic chapel was a way for the sisters to get to the choir loft from the chapel. While they could use a ladder to access the loft, they felt this was both inappropriate and dangerous due to their robes. A conventional staircase would have taken too much space and marred the aesthetics of the space. With no other recourse, the sisters did what they do best - they prayed.They prayed for nine straight days - to St. Joseph, patron saint of carpenters - for a solution to emerge. Lo and behold, a mysterious shabby-looking stranger appeared, leading a donkey, who said he would build them a staircase. However, to do so, he needed total privacy and a few tubs of hot water. Using only very basic tools, he spent the next three months in the chapel building the magnificent spiral staircase, and when it was finished, promptly disappeared before being paid.When the Sisters and others examined the stairs, they were shocked to see it was apparently holding itself up with no supports and was made of a non-native wood which they didn’t know how or where the stranger had acquired. To top it off, the staircase, which was made with no nails, had exactly 33 stairs. (In the bible, 33 was the age at which Jesus was crucified.) The staircase was, for the Sisters of Loretto, a miracle.The staircase is indeed a mastery of woodworking. The twenty-foot-tall, tightly wound stairs make two full 360-degree revolutions, and indeed have no central support. And to make such a staircase using only wooden dowels is an astonishing work of craftsmanship.But for all the stairs’ beauty, they have some problems which are usually left out of the story. Originally, the stairs had no outer railing, and the nuns, terrified of tripping, would crawl down them on hands and knees (presumably after everyone had left the service). A railing was added ten years later. (One has to wonder why someone would leave off an outside railing on a very tight spiral staircase meant to be used by nuns in flowing robes.)While it is true that the stairs do not have a conventional straight central support, the tightly wound inner stringer (structure that supports the risers) functions as one. This twisted central support, however, has a downside: the stairs, built like a giant spring, also have a strong bounce to them and left people feeling shaken before a brace was added, with the outer railing.Finally, there’s the matter of the mysterious wood that the carpenter used: spruce. The carpenter and architect of the staircase remains unknown, though the work has been attributed to German carpenter Johann Hadwiger, despite little evidence for his involvement.The staircase has been closed for general use since the 1970s, officially because of fire codes, but more likely because the relatively fragile structure was suffering from overuse. Nonetheless, the chapel is a popular wedding destination, as a bride and groom can have a small, Las Vegas-style wedding there, with only a priest and two witnesses in attendance, or can pack the chapel with friends and relatives for a traditional wedding. For these events, the bride and groom may climb the first ten stairs of the staircase for photographs.While it easy to dismiss supernatural claims about the staircase, the stairs are still a work of beauty and craftsmanship that deserve respect on their own merits. In 1998 the story of the staircase was turned into a CBS made-for-TV movie, The Staircase. How the producers turned the building of a spiral staircase into a two-hour drama remains a mystery.",Wedding chapel's mysterious spiral staircase said to be miraculously constructed. ,"109 East Palace ,Palace of the Governors,La Conquistadora, Our Lady of Conquering Love","207 Old Santa Fe Trail Santa Fe, New Mexico, 87501 United States",35.6858,-105.9377,peaceloveblarneyraymondwinn1941chasepoptcemillsicatsstacichasepoptjjlchandler5mikewalkerbreaingramcemillsCollector of ExperiencesicatsstaciLaflaneurerraymondwinn1941tylercoleppeaceloveblarneymmbisonwythe,2009-10-09 00:00:00,"La Conquistadora, Our Lady of Conquering Love,109 East Palace ,Palace of the Governors,De Vargas Street House","Basilica di San Frances Musical Pillars,The Little Church,Church of Agioi Pantes,Église du Bon-Pasteur",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/loretto-chapel

The history of the catacombs, along with the church that sits over them, is entwined with the early history of Catholics in New York.  Despite often being overlooked for its larger and more elaborate successor church uptown, the Old St. Patrick’s Cathedral is a historical landmark itself. Here Bishop John Hughes, known as “Dagger John” for his sharp tongue and street fighting skills, protected the Catholic community from a mob of Protestants with a show of force of armed parishioners.  The Old St. Patrick’s Cathedral would be a refuge for newly arrived immigrants, starting with the Irish and then later the Italians, Hispanics, and Asians.  As Catholics became more established in New York City, many became successful in business, politics, and cultural influence. These new Catholic elites would later be entombed in the catacombs within the cathedral’s crypts and columbariums. Notable occupants of the catacombs include Congressman John Kelly, who was an adviser to Abraham Lincoln; the Delmonico family, who founded the oldest surviving restaurant in New York; General Thomas Eckert, a Civil War veteran and a major figure in promoting the telegraph industry; and socialite and philanthropist Countess Annie Leary. The catacombs display fine examples of 19th-century art and innovation. Original Thomas Edison light fixtures can be seen in Eckert’s family vault. Also inside the Eckert family vault are examples of tilework by noted engineer and builder Rafael Guastavino, who also provided tilework to other New York landmarks such as the City Hall station, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and Ellis Island. The catacombs were, for more than 200 years, rarely seen by anyone other than clergy, workers, and family of the entombed. But in February of 2017, the basilica decided to open the catacombs to the public. There are now candlelight tours, in which visitors may walk the dark halls of the catacombs and learn more about the rich history of Catholic New York.",Historical figures from New York City's Catholic community reside in Midtown. ,"REI's Wall of Litho Stones,Houston Bowery Art Wall,190 Bowery","263 Mulberry St New York, New York, 10012 United States",40.7236,-73.9949,Andres SchiffinoThe25thSEANETTA,2019-07-05 00:00:00,"REI's Wall of Litho Stones,Houston Bowery Art Wall,190 Bowery,Holiday Nostalgia Train","Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus,Bube's Brewery & Catacombs,'Catacombs' of Petrovaradin Fortress,Ripon Cathedral Crypt",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catacombs-of-old-st-patricks-cathedral

Something alien? A supernatural occurrence? Perhaps Newton was wrong all along? Actually, Gravity Hill is an optical illusion, a trick of the eye perfected by a slew of topographical elements in the area. Although the road at Gravity Hill is actually slanted downwards, visual cues in the surrounding region make it appear to be an incline. The steep, tree-covered hill to the south of Gravity Hill blocks the horizon, removing key frames of reference and distorting the scene. The ridge at the “top” adds to the illusion, as the dip north of the ridge makes Gravity Hill appear to point upwards in comparison. Just when we think we know it all, Gravity Hill reminds us that perception is not always reality.

83,Squire's Castle,"ghost stories,castles",466,824,"Squire’s Castle in the Chagrin Valley of Cleveland is a misnomer—it isn’t actually a castle, but rather the gatehouse to a castle that was never built. There are two versions of why this castle never materialized.In the late-19th century, Feargus B. Squire purchased 525 acres in the scenic Chagrin Valley. The English-born Squire started his career as an office boy at an oil company and eventually became the vice president of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Squire commissioned a New York-based architect and intended to build two massive, ornate European-style mansions on the Willoughby Hills site. The first (and only) building to be built was the gatehouse, which had three floors, a basement, and even a room for Squire’s exotic hunting trophies. The urban myth version of why the rest of the castle was constructed involves Squire’s wife Rebecca. She was thought to be unhappy in this country residence and prone to insomnia and nightly walks. On one night, she noticed strange movement in the trophy room and in her fear, fell down the stairs and broke her neck. Her death devastated her husband and he never returned to the castle and later sold it. The likely actual series of events is slightly different. Squire lost interest in the property and instead constructed a mansion in Wickliffe, where he later became mayor. His wife died under normal circumstances and not in the castle. The property was sold in 1922, but the gatehouse was abandoned and later taken over by Cleveland Metroparks. Given the extent of vandalism that had taken place, they decided to remove all the structures inside the building.Today all that remains of Squire’s brief stay in the would-be castle is the exterior shell—that, and the occasional ghost stories of Mrs. Squire. People have reported seeing a red lantern light and a female figure near the property. ","Ghost stories surrounded this “castle,” the only structure from a huge mansion that was never built. ","Warner and Swasey Observatory,The Girl in Blue,Hillandale Bridge","Bridle Trail Willoughby Hills, Ohio United States",41.5799,-81.4193,Rick JenningsTinySputnikslstraubbruce,2017-03-21 00:00:00,"Hillandale Bridge,The Girl in Blue,Warner and Swasey Observatory,Judy's Jungle","Dunskey Castle,Frangokastello Castle,Larnach Castle,Voergaard Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/squires-castle

However, there is a pothole along Route 6 in Pennsylvania that could swallow your whole car and still have room for dessert.Back in 1884, a coal miner by the name Patrick Mahon was setting off explosives to extend a mine shaft when suddenly stones and water began to flood the area. Mahon and the other workers fled the mine so as not to get killed. Once almost 1,000 tons of debris was cleared from the hole, the miners realized they discovered an enormous pothole.The pothole is believed to have been formed around 15,000 to 20,000 years ago by whirling glacial waters combined with sand and stones. In 1884, geologist John C. Branner determined that the pothole formed as a plunge pool at the base of an incline waterfall that fell through a crack in a glacier. In 1886, another geologist by the name of Charles Ashburner hypothesized that there was no waterfall and that the pothole had been carved mainly by subglacial meltwater. Regardless of its formation, this glacial pothole is a geological wonder: At 38 feet deep and 42 feet by 24 feet wide at its largest diameter, it could hold up to 140,000 gallons of liquid and would take 35 firetruck tankers to fill. The pothole was used briefly as a ventilation shaft for the mine, acting as a chimney for a large mine fire burning under the ground. In 1887 Colonel Hackley, the landowner, constructed a retaining wall and fence around the pothole, allowing tours to be given to tourists and geologists. The land was obtained by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1961, and the state formally opened Archbald Pothole State Park in 1964.Although the Archbald Pothole is often referred to as the world’s largest glacier-formed pothole, a second pothole was discovered roughly 1,000 feet northeast of the first. Unfortunately, due to lack of funds it was never cleared out, but it is believed that the second pothole may be even larger.",It would take 35 firetrucks to fill this enormous glacial pothole.  ,"Lackawanna Coal Mine,Seven Tubs at Pinchot State Forest ,Abandoned Knox Coal Distribution Center","801-859 US-6 BUS Archbald, Pennsylvania United States",41.5117,-75.5741,Chris Kudricherjeffery,2016-08-23 00:00:00,"Lackawanna Coal Mine,Abandoned Knox Coal Distribution Center,Seven Tubs at Pinchot State Forest ,Wilkes-Barre Abandoned Train Station","Haga Tingshus Jättegryta (Haga Courthouse Giant's Kettle),Norber Erratics,Carcross Desert,Basalt Plug",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/archbald-pothole

The original stone monument consisted of 12 upright stones positioned in a circle, all surrounded by a shallow ditch. However, most of the stones have fallen over the years and the ditch has been filled leaving just four standing stones, the tallest of which reaches up almost 17 feet high. While the henge is not as numerous as it once was, the spare stones that remain are almost made more picturesque for their scarcity.In the middle of the ring are the remains of an ancient hearth that had a path leading up to it. It is thought that the Stenness stones were used in some kind of rituals involving the ancestry of builders.

Once the murals had to be taken down due to construction of a light rail system, The Traveling Man statues were born. Each of the figures is built of polished metal sheets held together with rivets, all meant to evoke the railway history of the neighborhood of Deep Ellum.  Moving from one statue to another the story of the Traveling Man proceeds from birth to life. The first statue, called Awakening, features just a portion of the Traveling Man’s head and one of his clamps emerging from a pit of gravel as one of his songbird pals looks on. According to the story devised by the planners of the robot mascot The Traveling Man began life as a regular locomotive buried beneath an elm tree, but when a splash of gin was spilled on the roots of the tree, the weird folktale transformer emerged from the ground. Continuing down Good Latimer Street, you next find the huge robot reclining against a piece of debris salvaged from one of Deep Ellum’s old rail tunnels.

These macabre meetings were supposedly conducted and lead by a large billy goat which spoke and issued commands to the enraptured sabbath of witches who gathered. The truth of these myths cannot be proven, but in reality, these myths were powerful enough to scare the Spanish government into bringing the inquisition to the gate of Zugarramurdi.They rounded up the accused in 1610 and tried them in nearby Logroño in the largest trial of its kind in history. Over 7,000 individual cases were tried, mainly focusing on the woman accused, although plenty of men and children were included as well. 53 individuals were found guilty of practicing witchcraft. Many of them were marched to prisons and died along the way, while others were quickly burned at the stake. Years of non-superstitious beliefs later, all the alleged witchcraft was deemed traditional folk medicine and the Inquisition was deemed an atrocity.Ever since the trials, Zugarramurdi has been associated with witchcraft and today the town embraces its pagan heritage with such sites as the witch museum. The museum, which is housed in the town’s former hospital, was established in 2007 and features a number of displays illustrating both the reality and myth surrounding the local witches. There are “floating” dresses and cauldrons and goats heads on display, giving the proper due to the folk beliefs of the area and also the misconceptions of the witches. In contrast, there are also displays exploring the role of the female herbalist which was most often associated with witchcraft. There is also a film explaining the process behind the 1610 trials.The Zugarramurdi Witch Museum also takes part in the annual celebration of the summer solstice held in the nearby caves. The town seems to have taken back its identity not by distancing itself from its historic tragedy, but by embracing its legacy, warts and all.      ",A museum dedicated to the Spanish occult in a town that was terrorized by the Inquisition. ,"Cave of Zugarramurdi,Museo Santxotena,Pheasant Island","Beitikokarrika, 22 Zugarramurdi, 31710 Spain",43.2694,-1.5438,serflacMonsieur MictlanreeceRachelMolly McBride Jacobsonatimian,2013-10-30 00:00:00,"Cave of Zugarramurdi,Museo Santxotena,Pheasant Island,Château d'Abbadie","Buckland Museum of Witchcraft and Magick,The Museum of Witchcraft & Magic,Museum Obscurum,The Wallace Collection Armory",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witches-museum

The highlight of the ossuary is a complete skeleton covered in gold that hangs at the front of the chapel. The practice of moving bones from cemetery plots into ossuaries after a period of time in the ground (usually seven to ten years) was common throughout Catholic Europe until recently.

The Thain Family Forest, a 50-acre plot of trees within the New York Botanical Garden, is the largest surviving remnant of the city’s original woodland.The old-growth forest provides a rare opportunity to walk among trees that pre-date the American Revolution by centuries. The patch of trees has never been logged and has remained largely untouched. Visitors can traverse paths that follow the original hunting trails of the Lenape Native Americans and pass by marks carved by glaciers thousands of years ago.In a metropolis famed for its reputation as a concrete jungle, it’s a refreshing treat to meander among flora that has managed to withstand the centuries of industrialization and development happening all around it.The forest’s location and survival is no accident. In 1895, a co-founder of the Botanical Garden, Nathaniel Lord Britton, picked the northern part of Bronx Park for the garden’s location. He specifically sought a spot covered with a dense woodland. Though greenhouses and education centers were built as part of the botanical garden, the founders’ decision to leave the Thain Family Forest alone has preserved a rare piece of the city’s pre-industrial ecology.",This plot of old-growth forest is the largest surviving remnant of New York City's original woodland. ,"Bronx Zoo 'Fountain of Youth',Fordham Cemetery,Holiday Train Show at New York Botanical Garden","2900 Southern Blvd Bronx, New York United States",40.8644,-73.8757,Luke J SpencervblAnna Minsterimrantabish16,2018-01-02 00:00:00,"Holiday Train Show at New York Botanical Garden,Fordham Cemetery,Bronx Zoo 'Fountain of Youth',Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto at St. Lucy's Church","Fragas do Eume,Trollskogen (The Troll Forest),Redwood Forest Tree Art,Tambopata Research Center",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thain-family-forest

The abandoned buildings were purchased by William Randolph Hearst in 1931, part of his elaborate Wyntoon estate building project in Northern California. It took 11 ships to bring all of the stones to the U.S., where they were stored in a San Francisco warehouse.When the Depression began to take its toll on Hearst’s fortunes, he abandoned the project and sold the stones to the city. San Francisco made plans to rebuild the structure in Golden Gate Park—a project immediately complicated by a fire that destroyed all of the packing crates showing the key markings for reconstruction.Finally, in the 1960s, the remaining stones were distributed throughout the park, including the Library Terrace Garden in the San Francisco Botanical Gardens and the Japanese Tea Garden.Elsewhere in the park, so-called “Druid Circles” hide in the wooded areas and act as sacred spaces for occasional ceremonies.

The thousands of years of being closed to the air had preserved the rich colors of the mineral pigments in the animals, people, and arcane symbols.The Vézère valley cave system in the Dordogne department of France has the highest concentration of Upper Paleolithic sites in Western Europe. The scale of the painted figures and quality of the art make the Cave of Lascaux the most significant and impressive of the sites. Painted animals are not static, but in motion. Herds of horses, charging bulls, and the movement of felines, cattle, bison, and even a rhinoceros show a perspective in painting that would not reappear until the Renaissance.The most well known section of the cave is the Hall of the Bulls, which has four giant black bulls, including one that is the largest cave art animal ever found at 17 feet long. Interestingly, the animals are not what the people who painted them would have hunted. There are no reindeer, the most consumed animal of the time, and no plants or landscapes. Some researchers have speculated that the paintings represent an ancient star map, with constellations hidden in the lines of the animals.The Cave of Lascaux was open to the public for many years until it was closed in 1963. The over 1,500 daily visitors were causing significant deterioration to the paintings. Mold and fungus continue to endanger the cave, and it is currently sealed to everyone, with only one person at a time allowed to enter and monitor its preservation.While it is unlikely that the cave will ever again be available to the public, a replica opened in 1983 called Lascaux II, which simulates the site with recreations of some of the art.

As the Pope fled down the passageway, allegedly bundling his long papal robes in his arms to keep from tripping, invaders entered the basilica, fighting the Swiss Guard on its steps. Of the 189 Swiss Guard on duty that day, only 42 survived.The city fell swiftly and the Pope was held prisoner in the Castel for a month while the city was looted. It was reported that the population of Rome declined from 55,000 residents to just 10,000 in that time as locals were killed or fled for their lives.After paying a ransom and being held by invading troops for another five months, the Pope finally escaped to Orvieto, disguised as a peddler.The Passetto de Borgo looks to the casual eye like yet another old fortification wall, but in fact it still hides a secret passageway at the top. The earliest construction of the wall dates back as early as 850, but was created in its current form in 1277, then expanded and completed by the Borgia Pope Alexander VI in 1492, just in time for him to take advantage to flee invading Frenchmen two years later.For years since the last papal escape the Passetto languished in declining condition, closed to visitors (although the Swiss Guard have always kept a key ready for the Pope, in case of another emergency). In 2000, in honor of the Pope’s Jubilee year, the Passetto was renovated and temporarily re-opened.

97,Statue of Oscar Wilde,"memorials,parks,statues",1320,823,"Merrion Square in central Dublin is not far from Trinity College. One of Dublin’s famous blocks of Georgian homes, Merrion Square was once the stomping grounds of many prominent Irishmen, including the poet W.B. Yeats at No. 82, and straight across, at No. 1, the childhood home of Oscar Wilde. Wilde now lounges just inside the park, on a boulder of white quartz, sculpted from a colorful assemblage of polished granite and semi-precious stones. The sculpture of Wilde was commissioned in 1997 by the Guinness Ireland Group (yes, that Guinness) to commemorate one of Ireland’s most famous sons. A site in Merrion Square Park was chosen, and now the stone Wilde, in relaxed repose, looks straight out at his boyhood home where he grew up the son of the renowned surgeon and Irish folklorist Sir William Wilde.The colors and textures of the statue come as a bit of a surprise, with a jacket carved from deep green nephrite jade, collared in bright pink Norwegian thulite. His trousers are fashioned from sparkling blue pearl granite, with shoes that seem to be spit-shined from polished black granite. His face might seem a bit of a puzzle until you consider the intention of the sculptor, Danny Osborne, whose goal was to capture what he sees as the dual nature of Wilde – at once joyous and somber, both comedy and tragedy – looks that are captured on opposite sides of the face. The life-size statue of Wilde is flanked by two smaller bronzes, both atop polished granite plinths engraved with quotes from Wilde’s work. The first bronze is Osborne’s image of Wilde’s pregnant wife, Constance, and the second is his interpretation of Dionysus, the Greek god of the vine and the theater, by means of a simple male torso.Wilde lived most of his adult life in England, and he died and is buried in Paris – but he is one in a long and storied line of writers whose spirits are deeply rooted in Ireland.

However during his residence in the space, he has refurbished the rich interior to resemble a living cabinet of curiosities. The walls are covered in huge portraits of vaguely sinister figures like something out of a particularly ominous nightmare, and the surfaces are covered in countless statues and figures that seem to have been collected from a wide range of eras and areas (and possibly horror dimensions). Retsin himself consideres the space to act as a sort of museum.There is also a distinctly Cuban flavor to much of the space and the events inside with rich rum cocktails served from the old bar and Latin music playing. This owes to Retsin’s professed past of textile trading in Central America.

In its prime, the oddly placed town provided food, water, and postal services to trains passing through.Kelso was built in 1905, with the train depot at its center and other administrative buildings popping up around it. It was named after John H. Kelso, whose name was drawn from a hat. It was planned as a much-needed rest stop for the workers and passengers traveling by train along the parched desert railroad.At its peak, roughly 2,000 people called the small desert town home. It boomed during the 1940s after nearby iron and borax mines opened. But after the mines closed about a decade later, its population began to dwindle. In the 1970s, remote Kelso gained a reputation as “the town without television.” By the 1980s, it was nearing its final years. The train depot closed in 1986, and the town seemed doomed for demolition.Thankfully, locals rallied to preserve this piece of history. The National Park Service gained control of the site in 1994. The organization opened the train depot to the public in 2005, which now houses the visitor center for the Mojave National Preserve. The displays both inside and out give a great understanding to the historical significance of the station’s location.In addition to giving a brief glimpse into the past, the ghost town doubles as a well-placed rest stop between Las Vegas and Palm Springs (for those who choose a road less traveled).

It’s a collection of stones about 20 feet high, topped with a cross and decorated with gifts left by visitors—pennies, feathers, shells, fluffy stuffed animals, and tiny tea candles. The stones bear the words in stark white lettering: “Maggie Wall burnt here 1657 as a witch.” Scotland was home to nearly 3,800 people accused of witchcraft between 1500s and 1700s, the vast majority of whom were women. In the end, about 1,500 were murdered as a result of witch hunt inquisitions. However, mysteriously, there is no record of a woman named Maggie Wall being tried as a witch. What’s more, there’s no record of the monument itself until 1866, though a forest surrounding the monument called Maggie Walls Wood was documented as of 1829.Some claim that Maggie Wall did exist, her records simply didn’t. Some locals theorize that a member of the Rollos, a powerful family that lived in Duncrub Castle, had an affair with Maggie Wall and built the monument out of guilt. Another theory is that Maggie was a part of a backlash against a group of officials trying to elect a new local minister. The group was attacked by a horde of women, and some believe Maggie could have been singled out and punished. The accepted theory is that this monument stands as a testament to all the witches murdered in Scotland during the witch hunts as no other such monument exists. Perhaps the name was taken from the surrounding wood to represent the countless and forgotten women who were killed. Occasionally a wreath is laid at the foot of the monument, serving as a reminder of the injustices suffered by the mysterious symbolic witch, Maggie Wall. ",A mysterious monument where a woman who records say never existed was burnt alive for being a witch.  ,"North Inch,'Towser',Library of Innerpeffray","Dunning, Scotland, PH2 0QS United Kingdom 56.3088, -3.6081Visit Website NearbyLibrary of Innerpeffray7.33 milesNorth Inch9.42 miles'Towser'10.90 miles",56.3088,-3.6081,hcw2rpJaszmina SzendreyGreg JonesUpturnedTurniprobertdrummondthebodyinthelibraryUpturnedTurniptthebodyinthelibraryrobertdrummondWWijillysswansnestBlindcolourGreg JonesJaszmina Szendrey,2017-04-11 00:00:00,"Library of Innerpeffray,North Inch,'Towser',Abernethy Round Tower","Memorial to Alse Young and Lydia Gilbert,William Donaghy Memorial,Anna Göldi Museum,Paisley Witches Memorial",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-for-a-witch-called-maggie-wall

The hidden-in-plain-sight imagery of the designs is a fitting metaphor for the labyrinthine nature of the underground transportation system itself, and for the wider city environment, which can often seem like an urban maze.But the labyrinths are also, according to the artist, a spiritual metaphor for the daily journey commuters embark upon while traveling through the city.

It’s all part of the appeal of a building dubbed “The Coffee Pot.”The metal-clad, round building with an attached spout and handle was constructed in 1959 by Kenneth Wills. Known as “The Coffee Pot” or, among the Wills family, “The Teapot,” it served as a restaurant for many years.Initially a concrete walkway, painted red to suggest a hot burner on a stove, encircled the coffee pot-shaped building. According to some sources, original plans for the quirky building included a globe on top that lit up as if it were percolating.Ownership of the building changed hands within the Wills family after the restaurant closed, and a beer and wine bar ran for several years, followed by a gas station. Sources reported that the bar experience at the Coffee Pot included access to the private upstairs rooms for special patrons. A vacation canoe rental, then later a fresh fish market, filled the space after the bar closed.In late 2016, after a period of on-and-off residential occupancy, artist Mark Breithaupt purchased the building and began developing the property.

112,Highgate Cemetery,"rivals week,vampires,hoaxes,occult,catacombs,catacombs and crypts,cemeteries",2624,8206,"Opened in 1839, Highgate is one of London’s most infamous cemeteries, originally opened as one of the city’s “Magnificent Seven” park cemeteries. The initial design was carried by architect Stephen Geary.Among the impressive Victorian and Egyptian influenced tombs are the gravestones of Karl Marx (recognizable by the glowering bearded bust); sci-fi author Douglas Adams; James Holman, a sightless 19th-century adventurer known as “the Blind Traveler” (a pioneer of “human echolocation,” he was able to sense his surroundings by the reverberations of a tapped cane or horse’s hoof-beats); and Adam Worth, a famous criminal and the possible inspiration for Sherlock Holmes’s nemesis, Professor Moriarty.Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to the twin pressures of the health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries, and desires for build-able land in the rapidly expanding city.The cemetery’s tombs and buildings are constructed in an imposing Victorian Gothic style and during the mid- to late 1800s it was a highly sought-after burial ground. However, by the end of WWII the cemetery was overgrown, unattended, and in serious disrepair, all of which added to its creepy feel. In the 1970s the infamous cemetery became the location for another English Gothic tradition, the horror films of movie studio Hammer.  These films regenerated public interest in the cemetery, and stories of grave robbing, desecration, and vampires in Highgate began appearing in the news.As described in the book Beyond the Grave, “Many claimed to see a particular creature hovering over the graves. Scores of ‘vampire hunters’ regularly converged on the graveyard in the dead of night. Tombs were broken open and bodies were mutilated with wooden stakes driven into their chests. These stolen corpses, turning up in strange places, continuously startled local residents. One horrified neighbor to the cemetery discovered a headless body propped behind the steering wheel of his car one morning!”Known as the Highgate Vampire Sensation it culminated in 1970 with two magicians, Farrant and Manchester, claiming that each would be the first to find and kill the supposed vampire. Manchester announced an official vampire hunt, and on Friday the 13th, “a mob of ‘hunters’ from all over London swarmed over gates and walls into the locked cemetery, despite police efforts to control them.”The two magicians were supposed to settle the debate with a “magicians’ duel” but it never happened. Farrant was arrested in the churchyard next to Highgate Cemetery with a crucifix and a wooden stake and in 1974 was jailed “for damaging memorials and interfering with dead remains in Highgate Cemetery.” Though neither magician found the supposed vampire, in the various “hunts” graves were ransacked and real corpses were indeed staked and beheaded.The debate between Farrant and Manchester continues to this day, while the cemetery remains a popular location for occult, paranormal and vampiric enthusiasts.",London's creepiest cemetery was once the site of dueling magicians and mobs of stake-carrying vampire hunters. ,"World's Largest Potted Plant,Parkland Walk,Dick Whittington’s Cat ","Swain's Lane, Highgate London, England, N6 United Kingdom",51.5675,-0.1483,thedyerghoulhouseSEANETTAAnnetta BlackGhoatGeekjuliapetrushenkothesecretcitytthedyerghoulhousejjuliapetrushenkoJJulesRcc 7308cc46AdOYoctlssnghtsTeaAndCoffeeLoverMonsieur MictlanLauren LevesqueGhoatGeekGavingingercinnamonddavejenkinsCollector of ExperiencesllushjayehorkleyjameskmcglynnKrystalPeachSEANETTAGoksuMMartinnnoxrosaRRobOOllieVeeaanthonyhoggRachelmmbisonAnnetta Blacklittlebrumble,2014-08-09 00:00:00,"World's Largest Potted Plant,Dick Whittington’s Cat ,Parkland Walk,Isokon Flats","Jewett City Vampires,Tomb of the Mather Family,Warstone Lane Cemetery Catacombs,Znojmo Catacombs",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highgate-cemetery

Even the newer ones are from the Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance periods, and together, along with the formal gardens, they make up one of the largest castle complexes in the world.Along the north side there is a wild glen called Jelení příkop (the Deer Moat), originally part of the Castle’s fortification and later a private hunting ground for the king. The royal stock of stags (and even a few bears) is gone, and today the Deer Moat is a public park of inviting lawns and shaded woods, with a stream channeled down the middle. It’s all easily traversed via stone steps, paved paths, swinging timber walkways, and a 275-foot (84 m) pedestrian tunnel that runs underneath the famous Powder Bridge.The opening up of the Deer Moat and building of the tunnel were pet projects of former President Václav Havel, who wanted to give visitors an easier way to take advantage of the extended Castle grounds. He brought in Czech architect Josef Pleskot to design the tunnel, which incorporates the moat’s stream, much of which had been relegated to underground pipes in the late 19th century.Pleskot kept the stream, called the Brusnice, as part of the overall underground experience of the tunnel, an oval tube of elegant brick work that feels at once enveloping and expansive. The sloping curve of the walls was designed to create this sense of comforting roominess, to belie the tightness of the quarters–no doubt making some grateful claustrophobics in the process.Update as of October 2019: The Deer Moat is closed for the rest of the 2019 viewing season due to reconstruction.

It’s believed he was an Irish abbott living in the 6th century, though other more fanciful stories describe him as a thief. Some even believe that “Govan” is a mutation of “Gawain,” a legendary knight from the court of King Arthur who was said to have receded into hermitic life in his final years.Whoever he was, Govan was en route to Wales when he was attacked by Irish pirates off the coast. Govan ran to the cliffside, where the rock allegedly morphed into a secret cave for him to hide in. After his pursuers left, Govan decided to remain in the cave as thanks to God and to the cliffside that saved him. He set up a monastic hermitage in the cove, living off the nature surrounding, and remained there for the rest of his life.In the century following, the cove became an important site of worship known as St. Govan’s Head. The spring which the saint took his water from was said to cure ailments of the limbs and eyes. Sometime in the 13th or 14th century a small stone chapel was erected on the site. It still stands there today, measuring roughly 20 feet by 12 feet, containing nothing but a bench and a small altar, which Govan (or perhaps Gawain?) is said to be buried beneath.

A mysterious, fanciful structure that tops a knoll in the Airport Gateway District of Phoenix looks like the work of at least two out of three.Italian immigrant Alessio Carraro dreamed of building a resort hotel as the centerpiece of his high-end subdivision, Carrarro Heights. He and his son constructed the hotel over just fourteen months, between 1928 and 1930. The building was a thing of beauty, based on Italian architecture and tiered like a wedding cake.However, perhaps because of the stench from the nearby Tovrea meatpacking stockyards, or because of the Great Depression, it never opened. Carraro sold his castle and its 42 acres to Edward Ambrose Tovrea, magnate of the stockyards, who transformed the massive hotel into a private residence. Tovrea died after less than a year living in the castle, and is memorialized by a giant steel pyramid on the property. His widow Della lived there until her death in 1969.Over the years Tovrea Castle developed an air of mystery. As Phoenix grew outward and the land surrounding the castle developed into a metropolitan area, the isolated mansion and its acres of desert attracted a lot of attention. After Della’s death, the land (which had fallen into ruin) was purchased by the City of Phoenix. The structure was restored, its cactus garden replanted, and the grounds were opened for tours.Visitors on the rare tours (they occur intermittently every couple of months and usually sell out) get to wander across the Tovreas’ desert with its 5,000 plants.

Since the middle of the 1950s the place has been completely deserted.In the Kennicott mines it was not gold that people were digging for, like in so many other places, but copper. After copper was discovered in the area in 1900, a group of wealthy investors formed the Kennicott Copper Corporation (named when a clerical worker misspelled Kennicott) to mine the incredibly rich veins in the jagged mountains above the Kennicott and Root Glaciers.In the 27 years the mine was in full operation, the company made more than $100 million, and a company town grew around the mines. Partly because alcoholic beverages and sex work were forbidden in Kennicott, a nearby village, McCarthy, grew as an area to provide illicit services not available in the company town. It grew quickly into a major town, with a school, a hospital, a saloon, and a brothel.By 1938, the copper deposits were mostly gone, and the mine was shut down, and the town was abandoned. The railroad discontinued service that same year.Today, Kennicott is a virtual ghost town and along with McCarthy has a year-round population of just a couple of dozen people. Located deep in the heart of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, what remains of the towns offers visitors a taste of Alaska’s historic mining era. A number of the buildings from that era are still in use and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ",The ghostly remains of what was once the world's richest copper mine. ,"Guyot Glacier Ice Caves,Kuskulana River Bridge,H.A.A.R.P.","McCarthy Rd Chitina, Alaska United States",61.4861,-142.8886,varvara shishokraymondwinn1941Christine Williamsonjacobmunkhammarspiritmountain,2016-10-25 00:00:00,"Kuskulana River Bridge,H.A.A.R.P.,Guyot Glacier Ice Caves,Valdez Museum & Historical Archive","Chacabuco,Elkhorn Ghost Town,Centralia Ghost Town Church,Delamar Ghost Town",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kennicott-ghost-town
118,Deutsches Currywurst Museum,"germany,food museums,lost wonders,collections,food,museums",247,818,"Not far from Checkpoint Charlie, the iconic Cold War-era crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin, there’s a museum dedicated to a street food called “currywurst” - a peculiar, and singularly German, sausage dish.It was in 1949, as Berlin was being rebuilt in the aftermath of World War II, that Herta Heuwer got hold of some ketchup and curry powder from British soldiers stationed in Germany. Provisions were short, so thinking outside the sausage-box, she used these not-exactly-German ingredients on a traditional German sausage, turning regular “bratwurst” into “currywurst.” Herta started selling her international concoction on the street in the district of Charlottenburg, near Checkpoint Charlie. The cheap but filling sausage soon became popular with the construction workers, and business at her stand grew - serving up to 10,000 currywursts a week.The Currywurst Museum is dedicated to this novelty borne of scarcity. It is still widely popular in Germany, particularly in Berlin and other urban areas. The museum itself is interactive, and offers a lot of different ways to learn about and experience the wurst. There’s a currywurst stand, a currywurst computer game, a French fry challenge, and singing ketchup bottles telling the story of currywurst’s unique position in German popular culture. Grab a currywurst of your own and a snag a spot on the sausage sofa, and relish (sorry…) in the communal nature of street cuisine, this one offering a different take on Cold War Berlin, just around the corner from where East met West.Update: The museum will be closing permanently at this location after 10 years on December 21, 2018.",A museum dedicated to a Cold War era sausage. ,"Denkzeichen Georg Elser,DDR Watch Tower,Friede sei mit Dir","70 Schützenstraße Berlin, 10117 Germany",52.5088,13.3913,hrnicknhadams10mikehoeffnerhonzahol,2016-05-13 00:00:00,"Friede sei mit Dir,Denkzeichen Georg Elser,DDR Watch Tower,Führerbunker Parking Lot","Pizza Brain's Museum of Pizza Culture,Baked Bean Museum of Excellence,National Cookie Cutter Historical Museum,World’s Oldest Edible Ham",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/deutsches-currywurst-museum

The very first camp to stand in for the Voorhees’ bloody kill zone? A still-active Boy Scout camp called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco.The camp actually had a rich history well before Hollywood came calling. Located in the wilds of Blairstown, New Jersey, (the town is also featured in the movie) the camp was first established by the Boy Scouts in 1927 during their first season, which saw over 500 campers come to stay. Over the next few years, permanent log cabins were built, and once established, the summer camp operated continuously throughout the 20th century, even during World War II. While the camp lost some of its acreage to a proposed dam project that fell through, the resulting national park land that was established instead gave them access to much more wilderness.But it was in 1979 that the producers of the first Friday the 13th movie happened upon this camp purely by chance to film their slasher classic and forever change the way summer camps are seen. The film, designed to cash in on the popularity of John Carpenter’s Halloween, set the standard for tales of raunchy teens getting slaughtered, as (30+ year old spoiler alert) the mother of Jason Voorhees cuts a bloody swath through the camp.Other than a dream sequence scare at the end of the film, Jason himself is not actually introduced until the sequel (and doesn’t get his famous hockey mask until the third!), but Camp Crystal Lake was made immortal in the original. The Crystal Lake that Jason drowned in is actually known as Sand Pond. ",This Boy Scout retreat acted as Friday the 13th's original Camp Crystal Lake. ,"Paulinskill Viaduct,Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area,The Faery Cave","Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco 11 Sand Pond Road Hardwick, New Jersey",41.056,-74.9488,EricGrundhauserDrArchaealendog666erjefferyafigsemken,2015-11-12 00:00:00,"Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area,Paulinskill Viaduct,The Faery Cave,Jenny Jump State Forest","Lake Lure,Strada della Forra,Southmere Lake ,Jusanji Pond",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/camp-nobebosco

121,St. Augustine Airplane Graveyard,"object cemeteries,airplane graveyard,retro-tech,aircraft,lost wonders,ruins",105,818,"UPDATE: According to a local, about six months ago (as of May 2012) the owner cut the planes into segments and hauled them off to be sold as scrap metal; the planes are no longer present, and the field stands vacant.Close to the St. Augustine airport, behind a run down barbed wire fence that implies (though doesn’t out right state) that the land behind it is private property, rests at least eight decaying airplanes. Strewn throughout the overgrown flora, the skeletal remains of these hulking planes are slowly losing the battle with nature, painting a picture of technology overtaken.The planes themselves are 60s and 70s naval bombers, specifically Grumman S2 Trackers. A first of their kind, they were designed to combine detection with armament for the search and destroy of submarine vessels from an aircraft carrier. These specific planes, the S-2Cs, were also equipped to perform photo reconnaissance.They are currently owned by a man who lives in the area, and have reportedly been in the field for at least fifteen years. He stripped most of their parts, removing engines, propellers, wings, electrical devices, seats, etc. to sell back to the Grumman Corporation, then left the planes in the large yard where they have since been slowly consumed by encroaching plants.Vines have grown through broken windows, entangling themselves with tendrils of hanging clumps of electric wires; dead leaves have taken the place of seat cushions, and the removed nose of some of the planes offers a gaping view of the field floor. Tires, wing pieces, control boxes, scraps of the plane, and the occasional beer can litter the area surrounding the decaying metal shells. Though benign enough, one can’t help but feel the sense that something very wrong happened here in order to have so many abandoned and gutted planes and parts laying about, the eerie displacement is too curious to ignore.It is illegal to enter the premises, but a relatively easy-to-find opening in the fence has yet to stop photographers and curious passersby alike.

122,Christ of the Abyss,"visit florida,underwater,oceans,religion,water,statues,sacred spaces",248,816,"On August 25, 1965, a nine-foot-tall bronze statue of Christ was lowered into 25 feet of water off the coast of Key Largo, Florida. Known as the Christ of the Abyss, this submerged statue in John Pennekamp State Park was actually the third of its kind cast from the original Italian mold.The original Il Cristo degli Abissi, or Christ of the Abyss, was lowered into the Mediterranean Sea on August 22, 1954, just off San Fruttuoso on the Italian Riviera. The bronze statue was the work of Guido Galletti, inspired by a concept by Italian diver Duilio Marcante. It was to represent Christ in the new world below the waves, a memorial for all those who had lost their lives at sea and a monument to those who continued to dive beneath it.Seven years later, a second bronze sculpture was cast from the same mold. Like the original, it was submerged, this time off the coast of St. George’s, Grenada, in the southeastern Caribbean Sea. It was placed on October 22, 1961, a gift from Italy in recognition of the Italian crew saved from the sinking of the M.V. Bianca C, a passenger ship that had sunk off St. George’s earlier that year.A third incarnation, again cast from the original mold, was submerged on August 25, 1965. This time the underwater location was near Dry Rocks in the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, Key Largo (which, incidentally, was the first underwater park in the United States). The statue was donated to The Underwater Society of America by the Italian dive equipment manufacturer Egidio Cressi.The John Pennekamp Park was chosen as the statue’s final resting place after plenty of debate. It arrived in 1965, but had to wait until a huge concrete base was first constructed. Eventually, on August 25, the larger-than-life bronze statue was lowered to the base, the whole ensemble standing in 25 feet of water. It soon became one of the most famous underwater attractions in Key Largo, and naturally attracted plenty of divers.The top of the statue sits at around 8 to 10 feet below the surface, making it visible to snorkelers. But SCUBA divers get the best views (and the best selfies) of Florida’s Christ of the Abyss, diving down alongside the statue as it stands, arms aloft, among the coral reefs, an occasional barracuda or ray drifting past.",An underwater statue of Christ blesses the depths off Key Largo.  ,"The African Queen,Aquarius Reef Base,Underwater Hotel in Key Largo","251 County Rd 905 Key Largo, Florida United States",25.1234,-80.2971,Tony DunnellMrCarlOKonheimgreasekittenmichaelamiller,2018-05-02 00:00:00,"Underwater Hotel in Key Largo,The African Queen,Aquarius Reef Base,Betsy the Lobster","USS Oriskany,Kailashnath Mahadev Statue ,'The Vision of Constantine',Enlightened Heart Buddhist Temple",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/christ-of-the-abyss-florida
123,Curtis Creek Ship Graveyard,"ship graveyards,aletrail,ships,abandoned",203,816,"There aren’t many harrowing stories of high winds and raging seas surrounding the rotting half-ships in Maryland’s Curtis Creek. They were simply unused and unwanted—and nothing was more economical than unceremoniously dumping them along the shore.During World War I, the U.S. Navy spent $1 billion on wooden ships, intended to supply provisions to Europe. The ships were ill-built and ill-suited to the task ahead of them, and not one ever made the journey across the Atlantic. More than 200 ships built in Baltimore were burned and half-sunk in Mallow’s Bay, the region’s largest and most famous ship graveyard. But while the shallow waters of Curtis Creek hold fewer vessels, they represent not only the World War I era, but a real cross-section of the boats that have traversed Baltimore’s waterways over the centuries.One notable ship laid to rest here is the three-masted schooner William T. Parker, sometimes called the Flying Dutchman of Baltimore. Stranded in 1899 and later abandoned in the Outer Banks, the William T. Parker drifted all the way from North Carolina to Maine, completely unmanned. Once it reached Maine, the winds pushed it back down the eastern seaboard. A tugboat dragged the wayward traveler into Curtis Creek, where it has been ever since. As visitors boat or paddle along the creek, a dozen or so other vessels in various states of disrepair appear. There are several wooden World War I freighters, a sidewheel steamer called the Emma Giles that served as a ferry, and a concrete barge falling to bits. Although the abandoned ships disintegrate a little more with every passing day, they’ll more than likely remain here for years to come.

Rising up out of a weather-worn stone spire, the beacon looks like something straight out of a fantasy novel. The lighthouse was first built in 1897 just off shore from a castle in Andros. The stone column on which it was built had been shaped by millennia of natural erosion into the perfect pedestal for a coastal beacon. Unfortunately the original lighthouse was not long for this world, and was destroyed during World War II. For a time, the rocky outcropping went without a proper lighthouse, and the fantastical image created by the former structure was all but lost.However, the lovely beacon apparently had an extra life. The lighthouse was eventually rebuilt in the early 1990s by an oil tycoon who dedicated the structure to his daughter. The replica became Greece’s first automated lighthouse, eliminating the need for an onsite keeper to operate the light. But even with the modern upgrade, the lighthouse still looks like something out of Dungeon and Dragons, with the winding staircase hewn from the rock itself, leading up to the door of the tower.Since its renovation, it has become one of the area’s foremost tourist attractions, drawing lighthouse peepers and photographers who come to gawk at its singular beauty.  ","Perched on a spindly rock spire in a Greek archipelago, this lighthouse would make a perfect wizard's tower. ","The Temple of Dionysos,Terrace of the Lions,Catholic Church of Agios Georgios","Unnamed Road Andros, 845 00 Greece",37.8422,24.9454,EricGrundhauserhrnick,2016-04-08 00:00:00,"Catholic Church of Agios Georgios,Terrace of the Lions,The Temple of Dionysos,Lion of Kea","Ishikawa Island Lighthouse,Hudson-Athens Lighthouse,Colonia del Sacramento Lighthouse ,Three Sisters Lighthouses",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tourlitis-lighthouse

129,International Banana Museum,"bananas,food museums,collections,museums",234,818,"It all started at a photography convention in 1972, when Ken Bannister, VP of a manufacturing company, passed out Chiquita banana stickers to people he encountered. The goal, he said, was simply to get people’s attention and to make them smile. After all, what better way to garner a grin than by using the fruit that’s “shaped like a smile.”Soon after, Bannister started receiving banana-related paraphernalia – or “banana-phernalia” – in the mail. Inspired by his banana publicity, and eager to keep people smiling, Bannister then began referring to himself as “Bananaster” and “T.B.,” short for “Top Banana.” The nicknames stuck and “Bananaster” eventually became the founder of the first ever International Banana Club.Bannister received so much banana-phernalia that he decided to open the club’s first and only museum, the International Banana Club Museum, in 1976. Today, the museum is home to 17,000 banana collectibles, all of which have been donated by members of the club. Objects range from a gold-sequined Michael Jackson banana to the world’s only petrified banana. With so many objects, the museum holds the Guinness Book of World Record’s title of “World’s Largest Collection” devoted to one fruit.Membership to the club is a flat rate of $15 and, just like Bananaster, members can come up with their own nickname. Additionally, members can climb up in social ranks; the more banana-phernalia one donates, the higher the “B.M.” (banana merit) they are rewarded, such as PHB, Doctorate of Bananistry Degree. Banana Club members are said to get extra discounts when presenting their Banana Card Clubs in public, though a simple smile is what the club strives for. And if the smile isn’t enough, members can also brag about their fellow famous Banana Club-ers: Jay Leno and former US President, Ronald Reagan.The Banana Club Museum has bounced around from location to location over the last few years. In 2010, Bannister sold the museum; the new ownership is no longer associated with the Banana Club, but the international Banana Museum presently calls North Shore, California home.Update as of February 2022: The museum is closed indefinitely. ",World's largest collection devoted to one fruit. ,"Bombay Beach,Dos Palmas and San Andreas Springs,Salton Sea","98775 State Hwy 111 Mecca, California, 28752 United States",33.5212,-115.9354,anhiejondi letnapcrbesqJames RicciviajandUSAvoiding Regret,2010-02-16 00:00:00,"Salton Sea,Dos Palmas and San Andreas Springs,Bombay Beach,Dr. June McCarroll Monument","Bananenmuseum,Booze History Museum,Bulk Candy Store Museum,Pizza Brain's Museum of Pizza Culture",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/international-banana-club-museum

The slightly chilly façade is, at the same time, oddly inviting, as if to say “we are here to work, but all are welcome.” This style was sometimes known as “Swedish Grace,” a simplified and accessible classicism that had great influence on everything from furniture design to sculpture.Beyond its unique architectural design, the Stadsbiblioteket contains over 2 million volumes and more than 2.4 million audio tapes, and was one of the first libraries to allow direct access to the stacks without the help of a retrieving librarian.  It also hosts the International Library, housed in two stories of an annex behind the main building. The collection catalogs books in more than 100 languages, with more than 50,000 titles available to loan. As of September 2022: The library is currently being renovated.",The library's graceful rotunda is like a bibliophile's temple. ,"Hey STHLM, Stockholm Meteorological Station ,Stockholm Observatory",73 Sveavägen Stockholm Sweden,59.3434,18.0548,lyneebergergruddpersGreg JonesCoolCrabtylercoleBlindcolour,2017-03-13 00:00:00,"Hey STHLM, Stockholm Meteorological Station ,Stockholm Observatory,Astrid Lindgrens Hem (Astrid Lindgren's House)","Yangzhou Zhongshuge,Riggs Library,Millicent Library,Anclote Key Lighthouse",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stockholms-360-library

Since opening, the collection has grown to include over 15,000 examples of these small-circulating and often self-published magazines.The library’s first location, a detached shed in the writers’ backyard, was a space where people could look through the stacks and donate their own zines to the library’s growing collection. People interested in learning more about this DIY publishing and all the different places it’s shown up—from the punk scene, to poetry, to comics, to politics—can also take out up to five zines from the library for up to three weeks.Throughout the years, the library has been housed in several spaces, and most recently, it has found a home in an artists’ space along with several other art-focused organizations and studios. The entirely volunteer-run organization hopes to continue to build the zine community as well as preserve it. In addition to the library, DZL curates programs and holds workshops to create the next generation of zine-makers.

136,The Grove Park Inn,"supreme court,bunkers,cold war,nuclear,government,hotels,military,history",821,815,"In the event of a nuclear attack on Washington, D.C., Cold War-era continuity of government plans called for the Supreme Court to decamp for the mountains of North Carolina. Out at the luxurious Grove Park Inn, the court was to reestablish “normal court proceedings” and issue rulings on the myriad constitutional questions sure to follow. That was the plan, anyway.The story behind the high court’s secret arrangement with Grove Park reflects many of the quirks of the people and organizations involved. The isolation may seem unusual, but the reality is that each branch of government (and several departments) set up independent and redundant continuity of government facilities for the sole use of their employees. Such is the culture in Washington, where tribalism reins supreme. Congress built the Greenbrier bunker, White House civilians took Mount Weather, the military excavated Raven Rock, and so on. In mid-1955, the Supreme Court set about identifying its own relocation facility and sent clerk Harold Willey to hunt for a spot. Willey surveyed several properties in North Carolina and reported back that “Because all large cities are considered to be prospective enemy targets, a hotel in a secluded small city, wherein approximately one hundred people could both live and work, with spaces available for a court room and clerical offices, seems a most appropriate facility for the Court.” Making the case for the 141-room Grove Park Inn, Willey added that “A golf course adjoins the Inn and the new owners … plan to build a swimming pool.”A brief contract was inked on April 3, 1956, outlining how after a nuclear attack the Court would relocate to the property and take control of the entire thing. (The contract was discovered by the CONELRAD blog in 2013 and is online here.) The four-page contract was about as far as things went. The Supreme Court sent over microfilm payroll records every year, but never stockpiled survival equipment or built up a law library (which would have been crucial for a functional court). Unlike at the Congressional Greenbrier Bunker, security upgrades were never made at Grove Park.The Court’s indifference to doomsday planning stemmed from Chief Justice Earl Warren, who didn’t share his contemporaries’ bunker mania. Warren harbored no illusions about his prospects for survival in a nuclear attack and viewed continuity of government as a joke. Throughout the Cold War, Supreme Court Justices regularly skipped the drills evacuating federal employees from Washington. They also never actually visited the Grove Park Inn as a group. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedy Administration beseeched Warren to consider sheltering at the nuclear bunker in Mount Weather. The request went nowhere, with the Chief Justice complaining that  “I don’t see the passes for Mrs. Warren.” He stated plainly that in the event of an attack, “I’m not going to relocate, I’m going to stay with my family.”Half a century has passed since the four-page contract was penned with the Grove Park Inn, and the Cold War history sleuths at CONELRAD dug up Grove Park’s copy in a hotel filing cabinet in 2013. Lacking a sunset clause, it remains legally binding to this day. Let’s hope it will never be invoked.Update July 2018: The location is now an Omni hotel resort location, complete with an interesting underground spa facility with numerous pools, one of which plays music when your head is submerged underwater.",The U.S. Supreme Court's secret Cold War relocation facility in the mountains of North Carolina. ,"Biltmore Industries Homespun Museum,Moogseum,Thomas Wolfe Memorial","290 Macon Avenue Asheville, North Carolina United States",35.6202,-82.5429,Elliot CarterAdamTKincaidthomasnewman1jweingardt,2017-05-22 00:00:00,"Biltmore Industries Homespun Museum,Thomas Wolfe Memorial,Moogseum,Helen's Bridge ","Soviet Embassy's 'Summer Camp' House,Kelly Butte Civil Defense Center,'Cartwheel' Tower,Fairfax Nike Missile Site",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grove-park-inn

Netting and mosses form a bed in the center of the root ball, where begonias, fuchsias, and petunias bloom brilliantly bright and delicately hang down from the overturned tree.The Mendenhall Glacier itself is a rarity, as it is one of the world’s few drive-up glaciers. It lies at the foot of Thunder Mountain, where the Bowhays acquired a large tract of land in 1985 after a landslide demolished much of the face of the mountain, uprooting nearly everything and destroying one of the main streams.Steve, a landscaper by trade, set out to restore the stream and harness its water for a hydroelectricity plant to power new greenhouses. Settling ponds were designed to slow the rate of water erosion and provide a series of waterfalls on the garden property.Stories have it that while rebuilding the stream, Steve accidentally damaged the moving equipment and, in a fit of frustration, used the machine to pick up a large fallen tree stump and slam it upside-down into the soft mud. The image of roots hanging down like petunia vines apparently gave him the inspiration to repeat his action, inverting over 20 other dead spruce and hemlock trees in order to plant more than 75 flowers in their root bowls each year.Other flowers that flourish in this unique botanical garden include rhododendrons, azaleas, Japanese maples, devil’s club, elderberry shrubs, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock.

139,Jimmy Carter Smiling Peanut,"novelty architecture,presidents,politics",313,814,"In the 1976 presidential election, Jimmy Carter won his home state of Georgia in a landslide victory, with every county in the state voting in his favor. Some would attribute his victory to his local appeal to Georgians or his status as a Washington outsider, but it’s undeniable that a 13-foot peanut in Carter’s hometown of Plains played a role as well.Both peanuts and Jimmy Carter can be found all throughout Plains, Georgia, but only at the Smiling Jimmy Carter Peanut do the two come together. Standing at 13 feet tall and complete with a cheesy grin, this peanut was built by the Indiana Democratic Party to campaign for Carter’s 1976 bid for the Oval Office. The Indiana Democratic Party realized that peanuts had a local appeal, so their nut of choice for the monument was a giant goober, creating a connection between Georgians and Carter, a former peanut farmer himself. They even gave the peanut a smile, intentionally reminiscent of the toothy grin that won Carter millions of voters.In the end, the goofy peanut gimmick paid off. Carter won his home town of Plains and every other county in Georgia, propelling him to a victory against Gerald Ford.Since 1976, the Jimmy Carter Smiling Peanut has held its position as the world’s second largest peanut, “the most photographed thing in Plains”, and one of the oddest monuments to a politician worldwide. Unfortunately, in 2000, a reckless driver crashed into the peanut, whose wooden hoops, chicken wire, and aluminum foil weren’t enough to keep it upright. After the accident, the peanut was moved from the Plains train depot to the Davis E-Z Shop in Plains, where it remains today. Although the peanut has been kept in terrific condition, the surrounding fence became dilapidated as a result of over a decade of tourists posing for photos on it. Today, the peanut is circled by small maintained bushes.Perhaps the most interesting feature of the peanut, however, is its back, which has a sizable hole in it. According to local legend, the hole was carved by the Secret Service in 1976 to ensure that there were no assassins or bombs hiding inside the grinning goober.",This 13-foot smiling peanut in Georgia helped Jimmy Carter win the 1976 presidential election. ,"Georgia Rural Telephone Museum,Pasaquan,Andersonville National Historic Site","148 Georgia Highway 45 Plains, Georgia United States",32.0418,-84.3923,lewblanksalmson2a2ChubdiniCollector of ExperiencesDrew Harkey,2016-09-19 00:00:00,"Andersonville National Historic Site,Georgia Rural Telephone Museum,Pasaquan,Providence Canyon State Outdoor Recreation Area","Arthur Cottage,James K.

A set of stairs known, fittingly, as Jacob’s Ladder descends the ravine to the first bridge.The name “Devil’s Bridge” seems fitting here in honor of the strange construction, but there are in fact dozens, if not hundreds, of similarly named arched stone bridges throughout Europe. Like all of its counterparts, this bridge comes with its own devil story. According to legend, the steep ravine was far too difficult to span by ordinary mortal hands, so the devil stepped in with an offer: he would build the bridge in exchange for the first soul to cross it upon completion. The deal was made, and the bridge built – but when it came time for the first person to step onto the crossing, a dog dashed out ahead, thus saving the citizenry from eternal torment.Another detail of the fable is that when the devil realized he’d been outsmarted, he stormed off in a rage.

141,Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon,"jack london,repositories of knowledge,Unique Restaurants & Bars,shops,architectural oddities,architecture",583,814,"Opened way back in 1883, this dive bar was cool before any of us knew what cool could be. It was so cool that Jack London would often hang out here. (The proprietors of the place say that London wrote his notes for what would eventually become Call of the Wild while drinking at the bar—it’s also mentioned several times by name in his novels John Barleycorn and The Tales of the Fish Patrol.)Originally built from the remains of a whaling vessel, Heinold’s First and Last Chance Saloon is a shack situated on the corner of Jack London Square in Oakland, California. It has been in continuous operation since 1883. And, frankly, it looks like it. But that’s part of the appeal—hey, they don’t have Jack London anymore to draw in visitors. This is one of the diviest of dive bars.The most distinctive feature of Heinold’s First and Last Chance is the floors that are not level – by several feet. During the 1906 earthquake the pilings under the building settled and threw off the floors to by several degrees, and stopped the clock in the corner, still set to 5:18. Nobody has bothered to fix this issue in the last 100-plus years. For that, you’d probably have to shut down for a couple of days, and Heinold’s just doesn’t do that.Another distinctive feature of Heinold’s is the signed dollar bills that cover some of the walls. Sailors and soldiers would sign their money and put it on the wall so that they would have some ready money when they returned to California. But most never came back, something that is clear upon your first visit when you have a chance to see all of the money that is still tacked up. Oakland, of course, is a port city and has been for a long time. Heinold’s, as you might suspect from the dollar bills signed by sailors, is a great way to appreciate a bit of maritime history.When you think about the dollar bills for a minute the name of the bar makes complete sense: It was a reference to the time that sailors had to drink heavy alcohol before heading out on a long voyage – the first and last chance. During Prohibition in the 1920s, the saloon stayed open selling soda pop and cigars. The term “last chance” is used by only a few saloons still standing in in the United States even though it was employed often in the 19th century.Heinold’s is the last commercial establishment anywhere in California that still uses its original gas lighting. The tables and other furnishings still date back to that old whaling ship from which the site was built. To this day, Heinold’s still houses the original potbellied stove used to warm the room; it’s been the establishment’s only source of heat since 1889.It’s not just the dive bar fans that recognize the value of Heinold’s First and Last Chance Saloon, though. In January of 1998 the Friends of Libraries U.S.A. added Heinold’s to the Literary Landmarks Register because of the role it played in inspiring some of Jack London’s famous novels. Only two years later, in 2000, the United States Federal Government listed Heinold’s on the National Register of Historic Places.According to oral tradition passed down through the ages from barkeep to barkeep to patron, during the Great Depression this establishment stayed open by selling lemonade, cigars, and sarsaparilla. Just ask the barkeep for a printout of the history of Heinold’s, and he should have one for you. They also sell booklets and other trinkets that illustrate the wealth of history.",Dive bar built out of the remains of a whaling ship. ,"De Lauers Super Newsstand,Bay Area Thelemic Temple,Ratto's Market & Deli","48 Webster St. Jack London Square Oakland, California",37.7938,-122.2746,brettyounghlbowlanLouchebonvivantSEANETTAMartinAnnetta BlackhhlbowlanemorataLouchebonvivantccarloswalker1977SEANETTAMMartinrrenkesslerRacheljlevNicholas JacksonAnnetta Black,2012-07-08 00:00:00,"Ratto's Market & Deli,Bay Area Thelemic Temple,De Lauers Super Newsstand,Kaiser Convention Center","Ithaa Undersea Restaurant,Jean Lafitte's Old Absinthe House,Gibeau Orange Julep,Legs Inn",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/heinolds-first-and-last-chance-saloon
142,Clear Lake,"travel oregon 2019,travel oregon",164,815,"Named for its exceptional transparency, Oregon’s 148-acre Clear Lake was created about 3,000 years ago when molten lava flowed down from the neighboring Sand Mountain and cooled, damming up a riverbed located at what is now the lake’s southern end.At an altitude of over 3,000 feet, Clear Lake’s temperature hovers just above freezing year-round. Relatively free of contaminants, Clear Lake’s waters are crystalline enough to see into its depths and its most enchanting feature: an underwater forest. Ancient trees that were drowned in the flood are effectively petrified by the waters’ cold temperature, and they’re open for exploration. Kayakers and canoeists can paddle across the lake for a close view of the tree tops, and trained divers can even swim through the submerged tree trunks. The lake’s water is incredibly pure, comprised primarily of active underground springs that facilitate an extraordinary ecological environment. Melted snow from the looming Mount Washington also makes its way into the lake, the runoff filtered through the mountain’s system of caves and caverns by the time it reaches the base. Clear Lake notably feeds into the McKenzie River, which is the source of all drinking water for the city of Eugene, Oregon. The five-mile Clear Lake and McKenzie River trails meet and loop around Clear Lake for a picturesque walk. The trail is relatively flat for walking and mountain biking, though amateur mountain bikers should be aware that the McKenzie River Trail will lead them through a lava field forest, where dismounting is recommended.

As conditions worsened, a catastrophic avalanche struck the region, washing away the entire station, the Spokane Express, and a mail train standing at the station, throwing both into a nearby gorge.With nearly 100 people killed, it went down in history as one of the country’s worst railroad disasters. The incident emphasized the need for better planning and infrastructure in the Cascades ranges, and by 1929 the original Cascade tunnel, which had opened in 1900, was abandoned after a new tunnel was built at a lower elevation (which is still in use).Today, the site makes for a unique and chilling scene, with crumbling concrete snow sheds, partially collapsed tunnels, and a railroad grade slowly being reclaimed by the forest. Metals, cables, as well as the site of the accident can be seen along the Iron Goat Trail, a roughly 5.6 mile-trail northeast of Seattle, stretching between the Scenic and Martin Creek trailheads.The trail, which is quite eerie due to its tragic past, is named after the mountain goat that was the logo of the Great Northern Railway, the northernmost transcontinental line in the country in its day.

Public buildings from the era like the Pergamon Museum have facades that are still pockmarked by machine gun bullets and artillery shrapnel. One of the most evocative—and controversial—bits of scar tissue from World War II is found in the Bundestag itself, the home of Germany’s parliament, where some of the walls are still covered with graffiti left over from the Soviet takeover. The Reichstag (as the parliamentary building was then known) was a highly prized target by Joseph Stalin for its symbolic importance. Interestingly, while the Soviets thought of the Reichstag as “Hitler’s Lair” it was actually anything but—the German dictator loathed the Parliament and had never given a single speech there. Regardless, when the Soviets finally gained control of the building on May 2, 1945 the first thing they did was stage a photo op as a triumphant Hammer & Sickle flag was planted on the roof. After that, many wandered the rubble-filled hallways taking in the destruction, and sometimes pausing to reach down, take a piece of the ever-present charred wood, and scratch something onto the walls. “A dream came true” wrote Afanassev. “Moscow-Smolensk-Berlin” recorded another. Approximately 95% of the graffiti are simply names: “Ivanov,” “Pyotr,” “Victor, ” etc.Most of the graffiti was in Russian; a sooty word cloud of Cyrillic names, vulgarities and reflections. Other languages like Arabic can also be found in some places, reflecting the vast swath of territory that contributed manpower to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. “Bashkir” and “Groznyj” are two of the examples, referring to Bashkiria and Chechnya respectively.The Soviet vandals’ fingerprints on the Reichstag were largely forgotten about in the postwar period when shabby repair work covered up the interior damage with paneling. And that’s the way it stayed for half a century, until the reunified German nation set about restoring their capitol building for a post-Cold War future. In 1995 British Architect Norman Foster ripped out the paneling and was amazed to discover the text inscribed on the stone underneath. Foster was profoundly affected by the time machine-like power of the letters and he modified the architectural plans in order to preserve them. Historical appreciation was far from unanimous, however. Politicians like newly elected Johannes Singhammer (Now VP of the Bundestag) rejected the Soviet graffiti as hateful. “Death to the Germans,” and “The Russians were here and always beat the Germans,” are two notable examples. The preservationist and self-confessional school of thought ended up prevailing inside the refurbished (and renamed) Bundestag, as it did all across Berlin. As then Parliamentary President Rita Süssmuth later told The Atlantic, “this makes us stronger, not weaker. It makes humanity stronger.” Today you can see the graffiti on publicly available tours of the Bundestag. (Though a few pieces of the most vulgar, truly unprintable bits have been scrubbed at the request of the Russian Embassy.)",The walls of Germany's Parliament still show the scars of the Red Army takeover in World War II. ,"Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe ,Stolpersteine Holocaust Memorials,Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism",Platz der Republik 1 Berlin Germany,52.5186,13.3759,Elliot CarterserpentLuis Moratobesartbajrami2Auxburg,2017-06-27 00:00:00,"Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism,Stolpersteine Holocaust Memorials,Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe ,Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism","The Canaletto Room,B-1 Flat Top in Oak Ridge,Human Shadow Etched in Stone,Executed Russian POWs' Memorial Graves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soviet-graffiti-reichstag

His bosses took the bait and the ACAM was born.Today the ACAM occupies an entire floor of Funspot. At any given time, the collection displays around 180 games from the 70’s and 80’s. The outer walls are tightly packed with pinball machines themed after everything from KISS to the Harlem Globetrotters, while the rest of the floor is lined with row after row of tall arcade cabinets. Vintage games like Tetris, Toobin’, Galaxian, Tron, and Space Invaders are all organized by their publisher, with big signs hanging over the cabinets trumpeting, “Atari,” “Taito,” and “Nintendo.” Each year the museum is also home to the Annual Classic Video Game and Pinball Tournament where gamers from around the globe come and try to beat Guinness-recognized high scores. The museum’s collection of games stops at anything made after 1987, because as Vincent tells it, that is when the focus of video games seemed to shift into more violent, less artful fare. The ACAM also holds a number of games in a storage warehouse and regularly switches titles out, so the gaming experience at is almost never the same twice.

Many of the cages also have plaques describing the Biblical view of how every “kind” of animal fit on the original ark, and how these would reproduce after their kind into the millions of species we have today.Other exhibits on the ark include animatronics of Noah and his family. Some liberties have been taken by giving the women names from tradition rather than holding strictly to the Bible, which does not name them.  Private quarters, common living room, kitchen and food storage areas are depicted and described. Outside of the ark, the park also offers zip-line rides, a petting zoo, and a café.  There are plans to add on and expand the park. ",A theme park featuring a replica of Noah's Ark built to the measurements specified in the Bible. ,"Dinsmore Farm,Florence Y'all Water Tower,Rabbit Hash","Ark Encounter Dr Williamstown, Kentucky United States",38.6253,-84.5857,vonbuxterDaytonDUIdcardelinororyhmcleodketchiegrljellybean99ddcardelinojjellybean99rroryhmcleodketchiegrlCollector of ExperiencesDaytonDUIhrnick,2016-07-27 00:00:00,"Florence Y'all Water Tower,Rabbit Hash,Dinsmore Farm,Vent Haven Museum","Walt Disney’s Bench,Jingles,'The Little Prince' Park,Fairy Park",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ark-encounter
148,Weiße Rose Pavement Memorial,"world war ii,memorials,monuments,military",419,813,"It’s not difficult to find vestiges of Third Reich history in Munich - after all, the city served as the NSDAP’s official and ideological stronghold for years leading up to World War II. However, tourists are only rarely told the story of the Weiße Rose (White Rose), a group of student rebels led by siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl, who practiced non-violent resistance and were later executed by the Nazi authorities. Today, the Scholl siblings are probably Germany’s best known domestic resistance activists during WWII, though they are little known outside their home country.Most White Rose members were students at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, one of Germany’s oldest and most highly regarded universities. Most of the members had previously been members of the Hitler Jugend or the Bund Deutscher Mädel, and their exposure to Nazi policies and ideologies gradually led them to reject the tenets of National Socialism being imposed upon German youth at the time. The group’s actions consisted mostly of distributing inflammatory leaflets to the German intelligentsia, as well as spreading political graffiti throughout Munich and other southern German cities.On February 18, 1943, members of the White Rose, including the Scholl siblings, distributed leaflets in the university’s main atrium (which now contains the White Rose Organ as well as a small museum dedicated to the group located beneath the largest lecture hall of the university), and were arrested by the Gestapo and interrogated. They were executed by guillotine beheading on February 22. However, their final leaflet was successfully smuggled to Allied troops and later dropped out of planes across Germany, leading to posthumous recognition of the group’s activities and heroism in the postwar era.There are several memorials to the White Rose scattered throughout Munich, though the most powerful reminder of their deeds can be found embedded in the cobblestone pavement in front of the university building where the founding members were originally arrested. Bronze replicas of White Rose leaflets are scattered haphazardly across the sidewalk - Sophie Scholl is said to have thrown her remaining leaflets into the air upon spotting the Gestapo coming to arrest them. The square in which the memorial can be found now bears the name “Geschwister-Scholl-Platz” (“Scholl Siblings Square”), and a bust of Sophie Scholl can also be found inside the law school atrium. Though rarely traversed by most tourists visiting the city, the square and its memorials serve as a chilling yet inspiring reminder of the ideological strife that divided Germany during the Third Reich era.",These bronze pamphlets remember a remarkable group of Germans who fearlessly opposed the Nazis in the very center of their power. ,"Wunden der Erinnerung (Wounds of Memory), LMU Library,Pinakothek der Moderne Futuro House,DenkStätte Weiße Rose (White Rose Memorial Exhibition)",Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1 Munich Germany,48.1507,11.5804,DoctorMoog42Collector of ExperiencesMonsieur MictlanmatthiasheinrichAshtinklerrhumphrey171157423cchriswal2Monsieur MictlanmatthiasheinrichCollector of ExperiencesAAshtinklerrrhumphrey17,2014-07-25 00:00:00,"DenkStätte Weiße Rose (White Rose Memorial Exhibition),Wunden der Erinnerung (Wounds of Memory), LMU Library,Pinakothek der Moderne Futuro House,Eisbachwelle","Free French Memorial Cross,War-Damaged Utility Pole Monument,Monument to Fallen Partisans,S.O.E.

149,"""Singing Runway"" at the Abandoned Disney World Airport","airports,sounds,airplanes,music,abandoned",191,812,"Known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLPort runway, what appears to be just a wide spot in a side road was once a landing strip for small aircraft flying between Disney World and the central Florida international airports. Built in 1970 (or 1971, it is unclear) the runway was only used for a year or two–by Shawnee airlines, the only airline ever to fly directly into the Magic Kingdom–before flights were discontinued. The area is now used as a backstage parking and storage lot and is easily accessible by turning right under the monorail before entering the Magic Kingdom parking area. The closed runway was at one time used as a training area for Disney’s bus drivers, which revealed a hidden surprise for the trainees. Originally used to surprise the airplane passengers, the set of grooves, like those on the side of a highway, that line this runway play “When you wish upon a star” when driven over at roughly 45 miles per hour. Curiously, even if a plane desired to land on this musical runway it would be unable to do so, for multiple reasons. In the late 1970s the elevated monorail was extended near the end of the runway, making landing a plane there much too dangerous. Even Disney’s official plane “Mickey Mouse One” was forced to land on “World Drive” rather than Disney’s own abandoned runway. There is yet another, even stranger, reason that planes are not allowed to land here. After 9/11, Disney was given its own protected airspace and no-fly zone known as TFR 9/4985. So at lower altitudes, like those necessary to take off and land, Cinderella’s castle has the same airspace protections as the White House. Florida’s pilots are all very familiar (and annoyed) with the zone and give the parks a wide berth. (Recently Disney has applied to be able to fly its own drones within the zone, angering pilots who felt Disney never should have gotten the protection in the first place.)Despite the many reasons that no planes will ever again land on the Lake Buena Vista STOLPort, the Magic Kingdom’s musical runway remains, waiting to “wish upon a star” with you. Update: Though the airstrip itself still exists, the set of musical grooves was removed in 2008 and can no longer be experienced.","The only runway directly into the magic kingdom has been closed since 1972, but it still sings to you if you drive fast enough. ","Randall Knife Museum,Mickey Pylon,Progress City Model","3780 World Dr Orlando, Florida, 32836 United States",28.3987,-81.571,collinqburkemichaelaschmidbauerPoetKingwillfaulknermtppilotvbloodl17wwillfaulknerAtakPoetKingcclarkbhm1vvbloodl17mtppilotmmichaelaschmidbauerAAF,2016-06-27 00:00:00,"Progress City Model,Mickey Pylon,Randall Knife Museum,Monument of States","Talasea Airstrip ,Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport,Buitenschot Land Art Park,McNamara Terminal Light Tunnel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/singing-runway-at-the-abandoned-disney-world-airport
150,Hotel Majestic,"ghost stories,haunted,places to stay,hotels",279,812,"The Hotel Majestic is charming, elegant and is San Francisco’s oldest continuously operating hotel. It also has another attribute: the fourth floor is said by many guests, and the hotel itself, to be haunted.It is somewhat shocking the hotel is even still standing. Built in 1902 on the estate of California State Legislature member Milton Schmidt, and when Senator Schmidt moved in 1904, the building officially became the Hotel Majestic. Amazingly it managed to avoid damage from the 1906 Great Earthquake, the fires stopping only two blocks away from the hotel.The ghost said to walk the hallways of the fourth floor is that of a young woman. Long term residents of this Pacific Heights neighborhood believe it to be the daughter of the first owner Schmidt, who refused to leave the building after it was sold. The portrait of the young woman said to haunt the halls hangs downstairs in the lobby. There are many personal stories regarding the supposedly haunted fourth floor. Common experiences include the bathtubs (the majority of which sport clawed, brass feet) mysteriously filling with water, the sound of footsteps and keys clanging along the walls outside, faucets turning on and waking guests in the middle of the night, and strange dreams or nightmares. Skeptics point out that nearly all the phenomena can be explained by old plumbing and changes in water pressure.Nonetheless, the joy of a good ghost story is hard to deny. The “Sweet November” production manager stayed in the Hotel Majestic during filming of the movie, and reportedly told one of the desk clerks that she felt her bed shaking in the night, thinking there was an earthquake-there wasn’t.A clerk who was delivering pillows to room 408, adjacent to room 407 which is often considered the ‘most haunted’ room, was frightened by a more uncommon event. When the woman walked in to set down the pillows, she felt two hands on her shoulders pushing her back. The hotel and many guests claim the haunting to be friendly, if cheeky and playful. Surviving over a century, the Hotel Majestic has been surrounded by change over the years. It has, however, kept close to its original architecture, and the rooms reflect both turn of the century design as well as strong Victorian accents and an Edwardian styling. English and French antiques, old fashioned clawed-foot bathtubs, fireplaces, double sinks, bay windows, and Victorian furniture adorn three kinds of rooms: Standard Queen, Junior Suites, and One Bedroom Suites. Panel drapery and four poster beds preserve the romantic and from-the-past atmosphere.","San Francisco's oldest operating hotel, with a Victorian atmosphere and a ""haunted"" fourth floor. ","Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption,Audium Theatre of Sound-Sculptured Space,Tobin House","1500 Sutter Street San Francisco, California, 94109 United States",37.7872,-122.4254,renakabambisonRachelaprilmackillinspilastr,2016-05-05 00:00:00,"Audium Theatre of Sound-Sculptured Space,Tobin House,Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption,Portrait of Emperor Norton","The Mizpah Hotel,Gran Hotel Bolivar,Hotel Alex Johnson,Providence Biltmore",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-majestic
151,Brooklyn Army Terminal Building B ,"wwi,world's largest,military history,world war ii,military,architecture",195,812,"The architectural highlight of the enormous Brooklyn Army Terminal is the central atrium of Building B, a space that looks unlike anything you will find in a modern warehouse or factory.Built as an intermodal rail and marine terminal to facilitate the movement of troops and supplies to Europe during World War I, the Brooklyn Army Terminal was designed by renowned architect Cass Gilbert, best know for creating ornate and grandiose structures like the Woolworth Building, the Supreme Court, and the New York Customs House. When it was completed in September 1919 – 10 months after the war had ended – it was, in fact, the largest concrete building in the world, said to contain as much building material as the Great Pyramid of Cheops, and longer than the Woolworth Building is tall.The complex is made up of two nearly-identical main buildings, the primary difference between the two is Building B’s central atrium. Freight trains could drive directly into the building and unload their cargo onto the loading docks. Two 5-ton traveling electric cranes spanned overhead, each able to move the width and length of the space on a track. Each could lower a cable that would then be attached to items unloaded from the trains. The offset balconies were designed so that this overhead crane can deposit cargo in each level and each sector of the building. Once deposited into the warehouse, cargo could be moved through the buildings by means of a network of connecting skybridges, and eventually moved down onto three enormous waterfront piers and loaded onto ships. During World War II, roughly 20,000 people worked at the complex, moving cargo as well as troops to fronts across the globe. Despite its enormous size, the Army Terminal was not the largest military supply base in the country, or even in New York City, but it did serve as the headquarters for the New York Port of Embarkation, a vast network of warehouses, piers, supply depots and camps scattered across the region that moved more troops and matieriel than any other port in the country.The Terminal continued to operate in the post-war period, but by 1966, changing technologies, especially containerized cargo, had made this whole facility – and especially its atrium – obsolete. That year the Army Terminal was decommissioned, though it limped along with a few federal agencies continuing to occupy its cavernous spaces. In 1981, the complex was sold to New York City, and it is now a thriving industrial park, home to more than 100 businesses and employing more than 3,600 New Yorkers in a variety of industries.Trains can no longer drive into the atrium – lobbies on either end of the building have severed the rail link – and the cranes aren’t functional. Despite the quiet, almost ghostly feeling of the atrium, Building B is fully occupied with tenants, and the atrium basically serves as a very, very large hallway for the building, but it still has many historical artifacts of note. The cranes are still in place with their old signage, and the balconies have been repurposed by tenants as sitting areas, gardens, and a place for their HVAC units. A somewhat anachronous Long Island Railroad bar car, moved into the space 30 years ago as decoration, sits on one of the tracks. And scattered throughout that atrium, you can still find markings noting destinations for military cargo – South America, Greece, India, and the Azores.The Brooklyn Army Terminal is a secure industrial park, and it is not accessible to the public. However, the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which operates the site, in partnership with Turnstile Tours offers tours twice a month that explore the site, its history, and the contemporary uses, including visiting the atrium and unrestored areas of Building A. There are other opportunities to visit the site throughout the year, including Open House New York in October.","Empty, but not abandoned, this cavernous Brooklyn loading dock was once considered the largest individual building in the world. ","Karen Deli Grocery,Staten Island's Lost Subway Tunnel,Barkaloo Cemetery ","140 58th Street Brooklyn, New York, 11220 United States",40.6448,-74.0238,EricGrundhauserghostfilmafgustafmarla m ww,2015-04-13 00:00:00,"Staten Island's Lost Subway Tunnel,Karen Deli Grocery,Barkaloo Cemetery ,Sunset Park's 68th Precinct ","Jinja War Cemetery,Brooklands Racetrack Remains,B-23 'Dragon Bomber' Wreckage ,Wreck of the Steam Trawler Sheraton",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brooklyn-army-terminal-building-b

In response, a team of twelve women, part of the Springfield Women’s Athletic Club, went forward into the unknown cavern with their ropes and lanterns, mapping the location and becoming local legends in the process. Inside the cave the women proudly carved their names, cementing their part in the history of the great caverns.The caves were put to good use during another substantial piece of history when, during the Prohibition era, the cave became the site of various speakeasies. Once that use ran its course, and it was given the impressive title “Fantastic Caverns” in the ’50s, it became a well-regarded concert hall.Today, you can tour the Fantastic Caverns from the comfort of a Jeep-drawn tram that leads you through the majority of the cave, a safe and comfortable way to experience what the cave feels like when the lights are out, and a chance to drive by the graffitied rock with the explorers’ names with minimal effort.","The show pony of cave systems, Fantastic Caverns manages to live up to its name. ","Wonders of Wildlife Museum,Hubble Space Telescope Replica,World's Largest Fork","4872 North Farm Road 125 Springfield, Missouri, 65803 United States",37.2878,-93.3591,ophidiousRachelrb7558Darrell PowersMartinMark Casey,2013-02-19 00:00:00,"Wonders of Wildlife Museum,World's Largest Fork,Hubble Space Telescope Replica,Bonniebrook Home & Museum","Lacy's Caves,Caves of Filopappou Hill,Ice Cave of Bixby State Preserve,Corviano",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fantastic-caverns

Over time, the age of the automobile eroded the mountain’s status as a resort destination, and the hotels were abandoned and destroyed by fire and arson.

Lewis first opened the motel in 1950 and his family has run it ever since. There are a few other Wigwam Motels or “villages” still in operation including Wigwam Village #7 in San Bernardino, California and Wigwam Village #2 in Cave City, Kentucky.There are 15 private “wigwams” at this motel. Despite the name, the structures don’t actually resemble wigwams, which are round, domed shelters used by a number of northeastern Native American tribes. Instead they are are modeled after tipis, which are tall conical tents that are traditionally used by Indigenous people of the Great Plains. They are a popular, and sometimes co-opted, symbol of Native identity. The original developers thought that “wigwam motel” had a better ring to it than “tipi motel” and the name stuck.There’s also a museum and two smaller tipis that were originally used as restrooms for a former Texaco station. It’s clear that the Wigwam Motel truly embraces many of the iconic associations of the American Southwest: road trips, exploration and the aesthetic virtues and functionality of the tipis of the Plains Indians.",A motel dedicated to Southwestern nostalgia. ,"Bucket of Blood Street,Hidden Cove Petroglyph Park,Arizona Sake","811 W.

158,The Hydrangea Train,"flowers,railroads,trains",65,812,"The picturesque Hakone Tozan Railway becomes an international sensation from mid-June through July, when thousands of spectacular hydrangea plants bloom along the tracks. The Hakone Tozan Railway is a functioning train route offering transportation between Odawara and Gōra stations, while a 10-minute cable car extends the journey from Gōra up to Sōunzan Station by another 1.2 kilometers. From June through July, this pastoral passageway is embellished with tens of thousands of exquisite hydrangeas that temporarily transform the railway line into what’s better known as the “Hydrangea Train.” The flowers mark Japan’s rainy season, known as tsuyu, which yields arresting technicolor blossoms. The species on view include both native and non-native varieties, though it’s believed that the hydrangea plant originated in Japan. Passengers can enjoy all manners of hydrangeas—from lacecaps to mopheads—in a variety of colors, which are determined by the soil’s acidity.According to Nippon.com, one of the best places to view the hydrangeas is the 16-kilometer stretch between Hakone Yumoto and Sōunzan Station, where the cable car stops. There, thousands of hydrangea plants flank the train’s pathway until it reaches a maximum altitude of 750 meters, where passengers are met with stunning views. Lower temperatures, due to altitude, prolong the blooms into mid-summer.The hydrangeas were purportedly planted in the 1970s by railway workers to replace the wild vegetation growing along the tracks. As they spread over the years, the blooms became a point of interest for locals and tourists from around the world. Train line employees take great care in keeping the hydrangeas well manicured to ensure their longevity in the seasons to come.

Nestled in the patch of woods are some very big and quite significant rocks.These are the largest exposed boulders in Mecklenburg County by a significant margin, rising out of the woods as if they were picked up and transported from some other landscape far, far away. Their incongruous nature has been drawing visitors for at least 7,000 years.A proper archaeological investigation of the sensibly named Big Rock Nature Preserve was conducted in 1987. Stone tools, animal bones, and fragments of cooking pots were found among the boulders, as well as more recent artifacts, like a musket ball (likely from the mid-1800s). The study concluded that this area was used as a campsite and observation point by generations of Native Americans, whose ancestors crossed the Bering Strait from Asia tens of thousands of years ago, and who reached the Carolina Piedmont 12,000 years ago.The largest rock’s elevation, along with the sheltered areas created by rocky overhangs, provided protection from the elements and unwelcome visitors alike, and the creek that runs by this area provided a welcome source of water. The tribes that roamed this area for most of its inhabited history were nomadic, following big game across entire swaths of land. A landmark like this one would have been an important meeting point. These days, the people clambering on the large stones are likely small children showing off for their hiking parents, or those diving for shelter, or the teenagers who have left graffiti, cigarettes, and other telltale artifacts behind.

161,Old Newgate Prison,"prisons,subterranean,mines,tunnels,subterranean sites,museums",296,811,"With a number of sturdy tunnels and chambers already in place, a copper mine seemed a perfectly fine place to establish a prison, but the site which is now known as the Old Newgate Prison produced more escapees than copper ore. The future prison began as a copper mine in 1705, while the land was still a British colony. As hard cash was scarce in colonial America, Samuel Higley, the owner of the mine, used local copper to mint three-penny tokens from 1737 to 1739. These are believed to have been the very first copper coins minted in America, not counting counterfeits. Higley’s neighbors later complained that they were overvalued, so he changed the reverse legend from “3 pence” to “value me as you please.” Since many of them were melted down for other purposes, the so-called “Higley copper” coins are extremely rare today, sometimes even valued for a whopping $125,000.After the mine proved unprofitable, the ruling government approached the tavern keeper who owned the land and convinced him that he would be an admirable prison keeper and that the disused mining tunnels could act as pre-made cells. The barkeep agreed and after a few security alterations, the former mining operation welcomed its first prisoner in 1773. The captured burglar was assigned to an underground cell where he remained for all of 18 days before breaking out with the help of a former flame. This escape was to be just the first in a string of felons who were able to mysteriously sneak out of well shafts or past the meager guard force. Often inmates would simply disappear, their escape method remaining a mystery. Despite the barman-cum-warden’s poor track record, the colony held faith in the facility, continually adding fortifications to the mining tunnels, increased guard patrols, and even exterior walls. As Newgate’s reputation for an almost open-door prisoner policy faded with the new security measures, the penal facility gained a more grim infamy for the conditions in its black depths. Prisoners were given naught but straw to sleep on in the damp tunnels, which crawled with vermin, before being led in chains each morning to be forcibly worked in the newly constructed nail shop.As the years went on, the facility also began playing host to nearly every type of criminal from unruly boys, to political dissidents, to hardened murderers. Escape attempts continued but when they were no longer viable the prisoners turned to frequent and bloody rioting. By the time the prison was finally closed in 1827 due to its inhumane living conditions, the underground mine was known simply as “Hell” by its tenants.After the prison closed, attempts were made to resume copper mining at the site, but this proved as fruitless as the original venture. Today the Old Newgate Prison is preserved as a national landmark and maintained as a museum where visitors can see how a number of the prisoners escaped. Given the atrocities the prison would later perpetrate, being remembered as an easy place to escape from doesn’t seem so bad.   Update August 2018: According to the official website, Newgate Prison is open from July 14 to October 29, 2018.",A former copper mine which became a truly unsuccessful prison. ,"Memorial to Alse Young and Lydia Gilbert,Heublein Tower,Vintage Radio and Communications Museum","115 Newgate Road East Granby, Connecticut, 06026 United States",41.9627,-72.745,JoshClevertrousersghostfilme1savageFred CherrygardenRachelFred CherrygardenTeaAndCoffeeLoverkkristenwilloughbyghostfilmHistMAe1savageCClevertrousersRachel,2013-11-20 00:00:00,"Vintage Radio and Communications Museum,Memorial to Alse Young and Lydia Gilbert,Heublein Tower,Matianuck Natural Area Preserve","Nemocón Salt Mine,Stalag Luft III Prisoner Camp Museum,Paseo Túnel Minería Durango (Durango Mining Tunnel Walk),Pre-Hispanic Mine of Taxco",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-newgate-prison
162,Big Island Lava Flow,"fiery wonders,volcanoes,geological oddities,islands,geology",692,811,"Usually, when speaking of geological phenomena, one speaks of time in “aeons” or references events as “prehistoric.” But on the Big Island of Hawai’i, the vocabulary is a little different.Lava—or Pele, as it is commonly referred, after the volcano goddess of the Hawaiian religious tradition—is a fact of life that actively and regularly reshapes the land. It’s not uncommon to drive down a highway and find that lava has flowed over the road and rendering it inoperable, or to hear someone mention that a house or property was “taken by Pele.” On a hazy day, locals will complain of the vog (volcanic smog) and seasoned fisherman will tell you that the best place to catch fresh ahi is in the waters warmed by the lava pouring into the ocean.It’s no small wonder that Hawaiians and visitors alike continue to give offerings to the unpredictable volcano goddess. She exists as an unparalleled geological spectacle and an active reminder of the power of nature over man. Spiritually minded travelers who trek out to see the lava flows will often bring Pele wishes wrapped in ti-tree leaves (the same leaves that are used to make leis) or small gifts to leave at the site.It’s hard to describe the experience of being in the presence of an active lava flow. But to witness Pele in action, you have to do a little detective work, seeing as no one can ever quite predict where the flows of magma will crop up. The more scientifically-minded could do some research into fault lines and plate tectonics, but for the average traveler, the simplest way to do some lava-hunting is to simply ask around. People in the area tend to know.Lava, like many things that glow, is best seen in the dark. Because of this, many people perform their treks in the evening, but this can be challenging—and dangerous—for visitors unfamiliar with the terrain. Go with someone who knows the land, as it’s easy to get lost. Depending on where the lava is flowing, there may be organized hikes (where everyone gets to wear neon orange construction vests), boat rides, or scenic flights. If none of these are an option or you decide to do some do-it-yourself adventuring, just remember: lava may be pretty, but it’s dangerous.

Originally 180 acres in size, the estate was developed by Deering, a well-known conservationist, to conserve the mangrove swamps and dense inland native tropical forests.Built primarily between 1914 and 1916, the estate, designed by Paul Chalfin, is open to the public year-round except on Tuesdays and major holidays. Included in the sights are extensive Italian Renaissance gardens, a historic village outbuildings compound, and native woodland landscape.Deering used Vizcaya as a winter residence from 1916, when construction on the primary building was completed (construction on the grounds continued for at least seven more years), until his death in 1925 onboard the steamship S.S. City of Paris on his way back to the United States. After Deering’s death, the estate was inherited by two of his nieces. Marion Chauncey Deering McCormick and Ely Deering McCormick Danielson started to sell off bits and pieces of the estate to pay for upkeep and maintenance costs incurred by passing hurricanes. Two decades after Deering’s death, a substantial chunk of the land was donated to the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Augustine, Florida, and to Miami’s Mercy Hospital.Fifty acres surrounding the estate were held together and purchased by Miami-Dade County in 1952 for $1 million. After significant restoration projects, the estate was designated a National Historic landmark in 1994. Four years later, a trust was formed to serve as the museum’s governing body. In 2008, Vizcaya was named one of the country’s eleven most endangered historic places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.Over the years, the estate and surrounding gardens have been used for important ceremonies and events. In 1987, President Ronald Reagen received Pope John Paul II at Vizcaya for his first visit to Miami.

164,Yoho National Park,"railroads,memento mori,natural wonders,nature,ruins",551,810,"Almost onomatopoetic, “Yoho” comes from the Cree word for “amazement.” Featuring the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Yoho National Park offers incredible scenic views and stunning waterfalls, as well as unusual mixture of prehistoric fossils and modern development.At 4,900 feet above sea level, the Burgess Shale was a boon for paleontologists when Charles Walcott discovered it in 1909. This sedimentary rock contains fossils from the Cambrian Era, more than 500 million years ago. These fossils, some of the oldest on earth, depict the first multicellular creatures on the planet. In particular, the Burgess Shale helps scientists because the fossils capture the soft parts of the bodies with remarkable clarity, an important factor when studying invertebrates. The fossils influenced the development of taxonomies and our understanding of early life on earth. (UNESCO declared the Shale a World Heritage Site in 1981.)Yoho also features one of the engineering marvels of the railroad era. To bridge the divide between Eastern and Western Canada, the government built a railroad in the late 1800s. And laying tracks across the Rocky Mountains is even harder than it sounds. The Chief Engineer on the project designed a tunnels to spiral in and out of the mountains. Rather than a direct climb, the train followed a switchback of sorts, emerging ever higher as it twisted out of the mountains. The Spiral Tunnels are on view as a historical site of Canada in Yoho.Part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Yoho is connected to Banff, Jasper, and Kootenay National Parks. Grizzly bears live throughout these parks. There are 60 bears or so in total, including 16 reproductive females. They mostly live in the Northern portions of Banff National Park. The Canadian National Parks strive to protect the habitat of the endangered bear, while also protecting park visitors.Finally, the park has an unusual geological formation: a natural bridge.

Now, that home is the Freud Museum London. After he was exiled by the Nazis, the pioneer of psychoanalysis brought his life to London. The museum holds his extensive library, collection of antiquities, furniture, and the prize of the museum’s collection: Freud’s famous couch.The year was 1938, and with Austria’s annexation by Nazi Germany, it left Freud, who was Jewish, with little support and even less time to safely leave the country. He was encouraged to come to England, and with some international pressure, he and his family were granted permits to travel and settle in north London. Their effects followed, and the final year of Freud’s life was spent writing and seeing patients in his ground floor study.Though Freud died only a year later, his daughter Anna, a pioneer in her own right (particularly for her work with children), continued to live and work in the Queen Anne-style house for another 43 years. She maintained her father’s study and library exactly as he had left them, and made sure that the entire home would be turned into a museum upon her death in 1982.Freud is best known as the founder of psychoanalysis, which is credited with moving treatment of mental illness out of asylums and into hospitals and therapists’ offices. In the decades since his death, many of Freud’s methodologies, techniques, and conclusions have been criticized and called into question. But his impact on the field of psychology and mental health treatment is undeniable.The London house was arranged much as their original home in Vienna, and his study and library are now highlights of the museum tour.

It’s been the Outer Banks area near Frisco, North Carolina every since, serving various different purposes including a Boy Scout meeting place, magazine office, and “The Footlong Out Of This World Hot Dog Stand.”Designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, the concept was a portable house, made of fiberglass-reinforced polyester plastic, that could be constructed onsite and adapt to any kind of terrain and climate.

170,Bamahenge,"stonehenge,roadside attractions,monuments",276,809,"“Bamahenge”, a full-scale fiberglass Stonehenge, wasn’t built by Alabama Druids. It was conceived, designed and installed by Virginia artist Mark Cline and his Enchanted Castle Studios.Cline’s work is big, typified by the dinosaurs that dot the landscape around his Virginia studio. It was these sculptures that caught the eye of Alabama billionaire George Barber, who wanted some dinosaurs for himself. He had Cline install four—a brontosaurus, a T. rex, a stegosaurus and a triceratops—along the edge of the woods near Barber Marina in Elberta. Barber was so happy with the ginormous creatures that he commissioned Cline to create a replica Stonehenge for the marina property, reminiscent of the “Foamhenge” that Cline built in Virginia in 2004.Both Foamhenge (made entirely out of styrofoam) and Bamahenge are full-size, exact replicas of the real thing, right down to their orientation to the sun and the summer solstice. And since third time’s the charm, Barber added one more Cline piece to his collection: called “The Lady in the Lake,” it’s a 50-foot fiberglass woman floating in a manmade pond nearby.  It’s recently been reported that the original Foamhenge will have to come down, the land underneath it to be absorbed into a Virginia state park. There’s no new home for the foam stones identified just yet—maybe they can come and join their fiberglass Alabama cousins.Update September 2016: Foamhenge has relocated to a new location at Cox Farms in Centreville.","Alabama has a fiberglass Stonehenge.

The Beelitz Heilstatten hospital’s history lives up to its dark visage.Built in 1898, this disused hospital complex of approximately 60 buildings located in the district of Beelitz Heilstatten. Between 1898 and 1930 the complex served as a sanatorium for lung diseases, generally housing those with then-fatal conditions such as tuberculosis.During the first world war it served as a field hospital that treated the earliest casualties of such new weapons as machine guns and mustard gas. During this time it also treated a young soldier by the name of Adolf Hitler, who had been blinded by a British gas attack and wounded in the leg at the Battle of the Somme (This earned him the Iron Cross).Ironically, these experiences and his successful treatment would set the stage for the hospital to once again be used as a field hospital, treating wounded Nazi’s during WWII. Occupied by the Russians in 1945, it served as a Soviet military hospital for the next 50 years until 1995, long after the fall of the Berlin wall. The hospital treated everyone from Communist party members to the disgraced head of the East German government who was sent there after being forced out in 1990.Today, while a few small sections of the enormous hospital are used for neurological rehabilitation and Parkinson’s research, the majority of the complex, including the surgery ward, the psychiatric ward, and a rifle range, have all been abandoned and left to decay back into the surrounding forest. In 2002 it was used as a set for the Roman Polanski film ‘The Pianist’.As none of the complex was guarded until 2015, it was a popular place for urban exploration, drinking teenagers, and people looking to give themselves a good scare.In 2015 the ruins were outfitted with a canopy pathway, which allows to view the ruins on every level without need to enter them.

Though ivy climbs the mansion’s stone walls and its shattered windows reveal a gloomy, deteriorated interior, the gardens are meticulously maintained and bursting with vibrant life.Named for the standing rocky entablature the estate stands upon, Gibraltar’s mansion was originally built in the 1840s by John Rodney Brinckle. It was later expanded, and its lush gardens were added in the early 1900s by Marian Cruger Coffin, one of the first female professional landscape architects in the United States.By the late 1960s, the estate belonged to Hugh Rodney Sharp Jr., who sadly had no interest in its grand gardens. By the time he died in 1990, the gardens had become a tangled mass of overgrown flora, no longer the manicured landscape they were in their prime. After Sharp’s death, the mansion, too, became abandoned and overlooked.Thankfully, the gardens were restored to their original grandeur in the 1990s by preservation organizations. Verdant vegetation once again fills their many terraces, which connect to the shuttered mansion via an elegant, curving staircase.When you first enter Gibraltar, you’re greeted by a pair of iron gates leading into the Flower Garden and the rest of the beautiful gardens, as well as the abandoned carriage house, greenhouse, and garage.Wandering through the exquisite greenery reveals urns, sculptures, fountains, and iron gates embedded among the plants.

174,Pabst Mansion,"mansions,beer,design,houses,homes,architecture",609,810,"Someone once looked at this beautiful 19th century manse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and thought it would look better as a parking lot. Fortunately, enough historically minded people stepped up to prevent its demolition.This was the opulent home of Captain Frederick Pabst, whose title came from his years piloting a steamer on Lake Michigan, and whose fortune came from founding the Pabst Brewing Company.Pabst had this house built in 1892 on what was then Grand Avenue (now W. Wisconsin Avenue). During the nearly two decades that the Pabst family lived in it, it was the site of many a fancy party, at least one wedding, and ultimately, the funerals of Captain and Mrs. Pabst. The exterior of the mansion was designed in the Flemish Renaissance Revival style, and the inside features details in Neo-Rococo and Neo-Renaissance styles. At the time of its construction, it had 66 rooms and 14 fireplaces. Captain Pabst’s study had 14 hidden compartments.As the wealthy often did at that time, Captain and Mrs. Pabst filled their house with priceless pieces of art and furniture, making it a kind of art museum even as it was a residence. Their decedents sold the house in 1908 to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee, and it was the home of every Archbishop to follow (five in all), as well as many priests and sisters until the church sold it in 1975.After successfully dodging demolition, the mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and opened to the public for tours. Preservation groups are still working on restoring the mansion, considered one of the most important landmarks in Milwaukee, to its Gilded Age glory.Photographs and descriptions of the house from the days when the Pabsts lived there have helped with the restoration. The church had painted the Dining Room walls white, but restorers found their original color hiding beneath large mirrors that had not been moved during the painting. A photograph of the Sitting room from 1900 helped experts find the locations where images of palm fronds were painted on the ceiling, also hidden under layers of paint.","A giant, Gilded Age mansion that once belonged to the beer baron of Milwaukee.  ","Mitchell Park Domes,Kingdom of Talossa,The Bronze Fonz","2000 W Wisconsin Ave Milwaukee, Wisconsin United States",43.0392,-87.938,OneEaredDemon,2017-03-30 00:00:00,"Kingdom of Talossa,Mitchell Park Domes,The Bronze Fonz,Safe House","Beer Baron Row,Woodlawn & Frank Lloyd Wright’s Pope-Leighey House,La Trobe's Cottage,Spaceship UFO House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pabst-mansion

178,Frozen Dead Guy Days,"wondrous performances,strange science,festivals,rites and rituals,catacombs and crypts",315,808,"Prior to his death, Bredo Morstoel was unknown to all but two of the good people of Nederland, Colorado. In fact, he’d never set foot in the town, but lived his entire 89 years in his native Norway, probably never once dreaming that the bizarre events precipitated by his death would ignite controversy and plant the seeds for a wild celebration thousands of miles from his home.When Morstoel passed away in 1989, his grandson Trygve Bauge arranged to have the body shipped to Trans Time, a San Francisco-based cryonics facility where Morestoel was preserved while Trygve built his own cryonics chamber in Nederland where he lived with his mother, Aud. Trygve and Aud shared the belief, central to cryonics, that science would one day find a cure for the body’s frailties, and that forward-thinking individuals would have their earthly remains preserved to await the day they could be reanimated.Four years later, Trygve had constructed a shed designed to withstand all manner of natural and man-made disasters. He had his grandfather’s body shipped to its new home where he kept it packed in a steady supply of dry ice. Despite its exceedingly low-tech methods of preservation, the rudimentary facility later attracted another client, a Chicago man taken by liver failure.Plans to upgrade the fledgling cryonics facility came to an abrupt halt in the mid-90s when Trygve, who had been living in the United States without a visa, was deported, leaving the frozen bodies in the hands of his mother. After a flurry of town meetings and legislative action that resulted in Aud’s eviction and the Chicago man being returned to his loved ones, it was decided that Morestoel’s body could remain in his shed under the care of the so-called “Ice Man,” Bo Shaffer, whom Trygve hired as Morestoel’s caretaker. Once a month, Shaffer packed Morestoel’s body with 1,600 pounds of dry ice, keeping him preserved at a constant temperature of -60 degrees Fahrenheit (though professional cryonics facilities put the ideal temperature at -321 degrees, according to Vice’s Sam McPheeters). After the original shed was damaged by heavy winds in 1995, Shaffer led the call to build a new, stronger home for his frozen charge.The commercial potential of the strange saga of Grandpa Bredo (as he’s now affectionately known in Nederland) was first realized in 2002 when it was suggested as a theme for the town’s upcoming spring festival. Now, over a decade later, the annual Frozen Dead Guy Days celebration continues to attract all manner of fun-loving oddballs with promises of live music, adult beverages, crazy costumes, and a wide assortment of offbeat events. Trygve, who receives a share of the proceeds from festival-led tours of Grandpa Bredo’s shed, dubbed it “Cryonics’ first Mardi Gras,” according to the Frozen Dead Guy Days website. Popular events include Ice Turkey Bowling, the Parade of Hearses, Tuff Shed Coffin Races, frozen t-shirt contests, snowy beach volleyball, and the Salmon Toss.

After escaping a car crash unscathed, a member of the Icelandic Parliament had a 30-ton boulder moved to near his home because he believed that the local elves inside the boulder used their magic to save him. While there are many Icelanders who pay no mind to the superstitious elf-talk, there is a higher than average number of citizens that are believers.With all that said, it’s not surprising to see that there’s an entire school dedicated learning about these hidden people. Located in the thoroughly modern city of Reykjavik, the school has a full curriculum of study about the 13 types of elves in Iceland. This concentration comes with a set of published textbooks with drawn depictions of these creatures for reference in the classroom, or just in case you encounter one in the wild.The school studies Iceland’s other supernatural fauna as well, such as fairies, trolls, dwarves and gnomes, but they mainly focus on elves, because they are the most commonly believed in and “seen.” The school also offers five-hour classes for curious travelers which include a tour of hidden folk habitats and ends with coffee and pancakes with the school’s headmaster.

Made of re-enforced concrete, they housed immense cannons capable of firing a 16-inch shell 30 miles out to sea. The backs of the formidable batteries were filled in during World War II so that, should the unthinkable happen and the peninsula were to fall into enemy hands, the artillery couldn’t be spun round to wreak destruction upon New York.With the arrival of the Cold War, Fort Tilden became home to the Nike nuclear deterrent.

The bow and stern are richly decorated with carvings of interlocking beasts.Almost as exciting as the discovery of such a complete and beautiful ship, the grave goods contained some very mysterious items. The so-called “Buddha Bucket” is the most famous mystery. Decorating the base of the handles on this otherwise unremarkable bucket, two small brass figures seated in the Lotus position look like nothing more than tiny, completely out of place, Buddhas. Although it is possible that Vikings did have contact with Asian cultures (and in fact another Buddha figure is on display at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm) researchers consider it more likely a result of coincidental hodge-podge of styles from their many Northern European contacts.In 1904, at the time of the excavation of this remarkable find, there was no room to house it in the existing historical museum. In fact, two other ships, the Tune Ship and the Gokstad Ship, were also in need of a home. The first designs for the Viking Museum were drawn up in 1914, but it was not until 1957 that it finally opened its doors.The Oseberg, Tune, and Gokstad Ships are all now housed inside the museum.All of the ships were built between the years 800 and 900, the height of the Viking Age. The first ship discovered was the Tune Ship in 1867, but it is not in as good condition as the Oseberg or the Gokstad. The Gokstad Ship was discovered in 1880 in a burial mound along with two male skeletons, and is displayed with a reconstructed burial chamber. The Gokstad has also had new life in the form of replicas, one of which successfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1893 to be exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.There is another Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark.Update as of January 2022: The museum is currently closed for renovations.Update as of June 2022: Their website states that they will reopen as the Museum of the Viking Age in 2026.",Home to three historic ships from the age of Vikings. ,"Vigeland Sculpture Park,Fram Museum,Kon-Tiki Museum","Huk Aveny 35  Oslo, 0286 Norway",59.9043,10.686,Annetta BlackehorkleykatherinekemsleybreaingramRachelebonyconway1997ssophiamariemp3ebonyconway1997kkatherinekemsleybreaingramehorkleyMMartinRachel,2013-07-18 00:00:00,"Kon-Tiki Museum,Fram Museum,Vigeland Sculpture Park,The Mini Bottle Gallery","Rune Staff Collection,Piraeus Lion,The Lewis Chessmen,DEVIL-ish Little Things Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-ship-museum

When detonated, the bomb sent fragments hurtling into the surrounding buildings, killing 39 people and badly wounding many others. The amount of destruction totaled $2 million, most of it on the corner of the two streets.At the time, the corner building on Wall Street was the headquarters of J.P. Morgan, and was a well-known landmark in the city. Considering the circumstances and target, police surmised the bombing was an act of terrorism, and a possible attempt on J.P. Morgan’s life.Although some evidence was found, the case was never resolved and was dropped 20 years after the bombing. It is believed that the attack was carried out by Italian anarchists, in particular by one Mario Buda, an associate of famous anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti. Until September 11, 2001, the Wall Street bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of New York City.The fragments in the old Morgan building have never been repaired, and stand as a reminder of the explosion that occurred nearly a century ago.",Unrepaired walls from a 1920 anarchist bomb attack. ,"Museum of American Finance,The Press Room,Delmonico's Pompeii Columns","23 Wall Street New York, New York, 10005 United States",40.7068,-74.0109,atimianMichael BuscheharjesNicholas JacksonMolly McBride Jacobson,2011-06-24 00:00:00,"Museum of American Finance,Delmonico's Pompeii Columns,The Press Room,The Standard Oil Building","Skeletons of Roopkund Lake ,Smuttynose Island,Bolivia's Witch Market,Lake Nyos",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wall-street-bombing
185,Sputnik IV Crash Site,"crash site,astronomy,space,festivals,space exploration,technology,memorials",205,806,"Driving down 8th Street in Manitowoc, you may pass by an inconspicuous brass ring embedded in the middle of the road. While the ring may not appear to be anything extraordinary upon first glance, it actually marks the crash site of the Soviet satellite Sputnik, a piece of astronomical history that has given rise to one of the most bizarre festivals in Wisconsin.The brass ring in 8th Street is a memorial to a 20-pound piece of space junk that struck the town on September 5, 1962, after breaking off from the 5-ton Korabl-Sputnik 1 (called “Sputnik IV” in the West). It’s truly out of this world. The Soviets had launched the spacecraft into orbit two years earlier, in 1960, 5,000 miles away from Manitowoc. But when the crew had tried to return it to Earth a few days later, the spacecraft inadvertently went even higher into orbit due to a computer glitch. When Sputnik finally left orbit in 1962, most of it was burned in the atmosphere, except for a little chunk that crash-landed in Manitowoc. Once the blackened, fiery space junk crashed, most of the people in town ignored it, including two police officers, who assumed it was merely a piece of scrap metal from a nearby foundry. But when the officers heard the news that the Korabl-Sputnik had reentered Earth’s atmosphere, they were able to put two and two together. The policemen sent the space junk to the Smithsonian, who, perhaps mockingly, sent it back to Russia to remind them of their embarrassment. Two replicas were made, one of which is still on display in Manitowoc’s Rahr-West Art Museum.The crash landing of the “Kerplunknik” space junk is perhaps Manitowoc’s biggest claim to fame, and it has even been the inspiration for the annual Sputnikfest, a space-themed festival featuring the Ms. Space Debris Pageant, the Cosmic Cake competition, the Alien Drop raffle, and various other extraterrestrial oddities. What’s best is the ridiculous costumes that emerge, spanning from coneheads drinking vodka to Russians with a hammer and sickle.",A metal ring in the middle of the road marks the exact spot where the Soviet satellite crash-landed in 1962. ,"Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum,John Michael Kohler Arts Center,Rhinestone Cowboy House at the JMK Arts Center","Park St and N 8th St Manitowoc, Wisconsin United States",44.0988,-87.6577,lewblankbleachedrhodopsinTigerRAWkkatiemahorney,2017-10-11 00:00:00,"Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum,John Michael Kohler Arts Center,Rhinestone Cowboy House at the JMK Arts Center,James Tellen Woodland Sculpture Garden","Skylab’s Remains,Bracewell Radio Sundial,Museum of Space Exploration,Patricia Huffman Smith NASA Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sputnik-crash-site
186,The Museum of the Alphabet ,"linguistics,language,museums",118,806,"At the Museum of the Alphabet, in Waxhaw, North Carolina, visitors can do everything language related, from studying a replica of the Rosetta Stone to seeing how their names look in Klingon.Founded in 1991, the museum came together as a culmination of the study of minority languages around the world. William Cameron Townsend, a Disciples of Christ missionary, founded Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Summer Institute of Linguistics in the 1930s to facilitate the translation of the Bible into the most obscure languages on the map. Some of these languages had yet to take written form. Townsend then founded the Jungle Aviation and Radio Services organization (now simply JAARS) to help facilitate these goals by increasing access to remote areas. JAARS is the organization that oversees the Museum of the Alphabet, also Townsend’s brainchild.All of the research from decades of effort on the part of these organizations is represented in the Museum of the Alphabet, which features a chronological history of written language. There are 12 galleries in all, each devoted to a language or category of languages, including Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, and African Languages.Visitors can learn how minority languages are documented with new alphabetical systems using the International Phonetic Alphabet, find out how their names would be expressed in languages real and imagined, and see a working model of the Gutenberg press. Special attention, as per the original mission, is given to minority languages, such as that of the Gullah communities of the southeastern United States. One of the goals of the museum was to focus on the people who “made” language, the people Townsend admired most. Prominent among these is Sequoyah, the Cherokee man who took 12 years to create 85 symbols representing the sounds of the Cherokee language. As his system caught on among his people in the 19th century, increased literacy put them on an equal footing, linguistically, with the white English speakers they were dealing with, taking away what Sequoyah had considered to be an advantage.Of the nearly 7,000 languages in the world, almost a third of them still lack written alphabets, and the Museum and its parent organizations are still working to preserve these languages. Part of their motivation continues to be bringing the Bible to as many people as possible, but their research also increases understanding of the most obscure cultures around the globe.",Trace the history of writing at this unusual North Carolina destination. ,"Landsford Canal State Park,Upper Room Chapel,Big Rock Nature Preserve","6405-6519 State Rd 1113 Waxhaw, North Carolina United States",34.8646,-80.7418,GWSmackenzieprice13Greg Jones,2017-03-20 00:00:00,"Landsford Canal State Park,Big Rock Nature Preserve,Upper Room Chapel,Heritage USA ","Mundolingua,Sequoyah Birthplace Museum,'Shetland Receivers',Grave of Alexander Csoma de Kőrös",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-the-alphabet-waxhaw-north-carolina

189,Cincinnati Observatory,observatories,405,807,"Possibly the oldest professional observatory in America, located atop Cincinnati’s aptly named hill, Mt. Lookout, has been showing people the stars since 1873, but not always on the same hilltop.The Cincinnati Observatory was first built in 1843 after the efforts of Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel, a professor who was enthusiastic about bringing astronomy to the masses. The facility was originally built atop what was known at the time as Mount Ida, and its cornerstone was placed to the pomp and circumstance of a speech from former President and then-U.S. Congressman John Quincy Adams. Unfortunately, the former president was not long for the world and the observatory’s inauguration would turn out to be his last public speech, leading to the entire hill being renamed Mt. Adams.  Regardless of the president’s demise, the observatory continued to thrive, as did the city of Cincinnati. In fact the city around Mt. Adams became so bustling that the pollution began to obscure the sky around the observatory, making the spot much less ideal for star-gazing. Thus in 1873, the entire operation was picked up and move to the top of Mt. Lookout where it could escape the various pollutants that were mucking up their readings. Over the decades following the move, the telescopes were upgraded. along with many of the other facilities. Yet by the 1980s, the facility had fallen into disrepair. Thanks to the efforts of astronomer Paul Nohr, the telescopes were refurbished.By the 2000s the observatory had shifted its focus from research to education. However, the observatory is still in use today after a multi-million dollar revamp.

191,Chapel In The Hills,"churches,sacred spaces,architectural oddities,architecture",355,808,"The ornate wooden church known simply as the Chapel In The Hills was built to house a Lutheran radio show, and based both in architecture and construction on an ancient Norwegian holy house. Finished in 1969, the ornate church was built by Rev. Conrad Thompson, a Lutheran minister who had previously spent time in Norway and fallen in love with the rustic appeal of their historic churches. Looking for a place to house his fellow reverend and radio show, Lutheran Vespers, this new church was based on the famous Borgund stave church which had survived in Norway since its construction around the year 1150. Thompson actually sourced the original blueprints for the ancient Borgund church from the Norwegian Department of Antiquities and built the Chapel In The Hills to be an exact replica of its Norwegian forbearer.Like the original, the South Dakota recreation was built almost entirely out of wood, including wooden dowels that hold the whole thing together. It has been speculated that it was the wood’s ability to expand and contract with the elements across the centuries that allowed the Borgund church to survive as intact as it did. Both the interior and the exterior of the Chapel In The Hills are covered in intricate carvings which were etched by both local artisans and a Norwegian specialist who was brought in to recreate the themes of the original church.In addition to the replica chapel, two other structures were built in the turf-roofed tradition. Lutheran Vespers was broadcast from one of the turf buildings until 1975. However, the Chapel In The Hills is still owned and operated by the Lutheran church to this day. It is now a popular place for weddings and will hopefully survive for just as long as its Norwegian predecessor.  ",This replica stave church looks like a piece of Norway was simply plopped down in South Dakota. ,"Depression Era Dinosaur Park,The Rapid City Presidents,Art Alley","3788 Chapel Ln Rapid City, South Dakota, 57702 United States",44.0483,-103.2989,worldlywondersandcurioswisemandlittlebrumbleexploringwitheschn2mp60rebecaschandelwisemandexploringwitheschkostas1964athbreaingramrebecaschandelnn2mp60littlebrumble,2014-04-16 00:00:00,"Depression Era Dinosaur Park,Art Alley,The Rapid City Presidents,Hotel Alex Johnson","Basilica di San Frances Musical Pillars,The Little Church,Church of Agioi Pantes,Église du Bon-Pasteur",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chapel-in-the-hills

He also built another great monument, his own mausoleum.On March 29th, 1974 peasant farmers digging wells in the eastern suburbs of Xi’an, Shaanxi began to find ancient arrows and other artifacts of note. Archeologists descended on the site and quickly found one of the greatest modern archeological finds ever discovered, the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin.

Despite being smaller then the originals these 6000 clay soldiers occupying the area of a football field are still mind bogglingly impressive.Created by the reclusive Chinese millionaire Ira P.H.

Also at the park are displays of architecture, weapons, and other artifacts; a narrated video; gift shop; and koi pond.Update: The gardens closed permanently in February 2011, reportedly to make way for an expansion of the Grand Parkway.

These rocks included Oregon agates, obsidian, petrified wood, malachite, and jasper. However, it wasn’t until 1935 that Petersen began building things out of his rocks. At first, it was just a small rockery near his home, but over the years, Petersen built increasingly complex structures on his four-acre site. When he died in 1952, he had been building for 17 years, and had mortared tens of thousands of rocks together into miniature buildings, monuments, lagoons, and bridges.The result is in an amazing four-acre park, featuring replicas of historic buildings, bridges, towers, and many other wonderful structures–all created out of rocks and petrified wood.

Built somewhere between 1890 and 1893, this bay-and-gable relic from a bygone era once was a one of six identical, structurally intertwined homes on what was then known as Dummer Street. Time passed, the street names changed, and a particularly sharky land holdings company began buying up property throughout the neighborhood in the middle of the 20th century. Eventually, the owners of the row houses caved, but not as a unit. Each half of the row houses’ wholes were torn down at an excruciatingly slow pace… until 54 1/2 remained the only one left. This begs the question: how does half a building cleave away so cleanly only to leave the rest of it standing?Very carefully.

But if you’re the sort who seeks out a Lynchian heart of darkness wherever you go, look no further than Carleton Avenue S.Here stands the Georgetown Castle, a three-story mansion with a tragic and tawdry past. The castle, a former brothel, somehow manages to look demure, set back from the street and sheltered by unusually lush gardens on either side.Come closer, and a metal placard appears, seemingly out of nowhere, to offer tantalizing details about the mansion’s history. Architecture buffs will recognize the building’s Queen Anne style, resplendent as it is with overhanging eaves, mismatched gables, and overlapping textures.Of course, the castle’s spooky aura is more than just cosmetic. The abode was built in 1902 by a wealthy blackjack dealer named Peter Gessner. But poor Gessner didn’t get much of a chance to appreciate it (while he was still alive, that is).It’s said the second floor is haunted by Gessner himself, who only lasted a year after moving into his castle. In 1903, he died by suicide. There were rumors of foul play, but Seattle papers reported it as a case of lovesickness over his young wife Lizzie, who had recently left him for a chicken farmer.Before his death, Gessner made use of Georgetown’s location on the outskirts of Seattle to run a brothel and gambling saloon. It was a sordid start that would prove hard to scrub away. By the 1920s, the place was once again functioning as a brothel. Decades later, the castle was finally turned into a somewhat respectable boardinghouse, though it would remain haunted, quite literally, by its untoward beginnings.The castle’s second-most famous ghost, after Gessner, is said to be a disgruntled former employee. She’s a hazy figure at best, the details of her life and death obscured by a century of local gossip. In one version of the tale, she’s inexplicably strangled by a magician. Another, more likely story sees her shot dead by an abusive pimp. One moment, her name is Sarah. The next, it’s Mary. Today, the ghost has flowing red hair and a white nightgown. Tomorrow, it’s dark hair and kohl-rimmed eyes.Then there’s the story of an unwed mother, perhaps Gessner’s niece, locked in the castle’s tower and forever separated from her baby, a truly infernal infant whose wails rise up nightly from the garden weeds. Some say that it was a john or a pimp who murdered the newborn and buried it on the property. Others say it was Gessner himself.These days, the Georgetown Castle is privately owned and well maintained. The exterior is painted a pinkish orange and trimmed in chartreuse: a dish of ripe melon glistening at some hellish garden party.

The historic building displays a large collection of paintings depicting the American West, from the 1800s through 2000s. The Navarre building opened in 1880 as the Brinker Collegiate Institute, a school for women, but that didn’t last very long. In 1889 it reopened as the Hotel Richlieu, a brothel that featured a secret underground tunnel to the Brown Palace for guests to discreetly enter the bordello via the reputable Brown Palace.Throughout its history the structure exchanged hands a number of times. After it was lost in a card game around 1914, the new owner changed its name to the Navarre, in honor of Henry of Navarre, a king of France known for decadence, and turned the place into a dining club.Art collector William Foxley bought the building in 1983, and spent $6 million turning it into the Museum of Western Art, which opened in ‘86, but it didn’t go well and Foxley was forced to sell some of his most important paintings in the early ‘90s. The museum closed in 1997.That same year, the Anschutz Corporation took over and refurbished and redecorated the place. Philip Anschutz began collecting paintings depicting the American West in the 1960s. His massive collection of paintings has been housed in the historic building ever since, but the Anschutz Collection wasn’t open to the public until 2010.",The huge collection of paintings of the American West is one of Denver's best-kept secrets. ,"Denver Omelet Plaque,Mile-High Steps at the Colorado State Capitol,Big Blue Bear","1727 Tremont Place Denver, Colorado United States",39.7447,-104.9881,randibrownbriboliocyccommute,2017-11-27 00:00:00,"Denver Omelet Plaque,Big Blue Bear,Mile-High Steps at the Colorado State Capitol,Daniels and Fisher Tower","Null Stern Hotel Museum,French Shore Interpretation Centre,Museo del Barro (Museum of Clay),Museo Pumapungo (Pumapungo Museum)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/american-museum-of-western-art
198,Wyndcliffe Mansion,"mansions,eccentric homes,homes,ruins",90,804,"Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones was a formidable woman. A cousin to the Astors and aunt to Edith Wharton, she occupied a space in the upper echelons of New York high society that matched her considerable frame. In 1853 she had built for herself a grandiose gothic mansion in the sleepy hamlet of Rhinecliff, a hundred miles up the Hudson River.Designed by architect George Veitch with 24 rooms, the mansion was topped with a steeple towering over 80 acres of spectacular river views. Wyndcliffe was so magnificent and imposing it inspired a fashion among her similarly wealthy contemporaries to build their own palatial mansions along the Hudson Valley. But Elizabeth’s was the first and the grandest, and is thought to be the inspiration for the phrase “to keep up with the Joneses.”So overbearing was Jones’ gothic fairytale castle in the woods overlooking the Hudson that it terrified her famous niece. In her autobiography, A Backward Glance, Edith Wharton wrote in 1933 of visiting her aunt at Wyndcliffe, as though it were a bit of a horror story, even comparing the imposing exterior with her aunt’s imperious disposition.Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones never married, and after her death, the mansion’s later owners fell foul of the Great Depression, until in 1950, the house was abandoned for good. Today Wyndcliffe lies hidden in the thick forests of the Hudson river valley. Approaching through the forest. the first thing intrepid explorers will see rising out of the pine trees is the old turret. Like a latter day Manderlay, the house which inspired a generation of property tycoons, lies in crumbling ruins. Whole floors have collapsed leaving staircases hanging in mid-air. Half way up the walls, ornate wooden paneling covers arched doorways which once led to further rooms behind. The grand semi-circular dining room wing has all but disappeared. The surrounding 80-acres which once featured outdoor tennis courts where the players could enjoy cold beer piped directly from the house, has been reduced to two, and the sweeping river views have gone.Today, this imposing manse of a once formidable Victorian matriach is slowly disappearing, brick by fallen brick. Visit it soon, because before too long, it will be hard to imagine that anyone ever lived there at all. The only thing keeping up with the Joneses today is the surrounding forest that is slowly and steadily reclaiming what was once the grandest mansion in the state of New York. ","What was once a trend-setting, phrase-coining icon of architectural splendor is now a rotting, forgotten hulk.  ","Lite Brite Neon Studio,Esopus Island,Wilderstein Mansion","Mill Road Rhinebeck, New York, 12572 United States",41.887,-73.9364,Luke J SpencerTheKopasClanMDBwendisimo76opieghostfilm,2013-10-26 00:00:00,"Wilderstein Mansion,Esopus Island,Lite Brite Neon Studio,Four Corners","Vaile Mansion,Seiberling Mansion,Milner Field Ruins,Thunderbird Lodge",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wyndcliffe-mansion

Once known as Stone’s Gristmill, the building began as a grain mill for local families in the 1830s, and was used as a water powered drill press in the 1940s before being bought and transformed in 1987.The maze-like aisles and staircase make the book searching nearly as enjoyable as the book browsing: in every corner you’ll find an armchair, bench, or couch to take in the view over the fast moving river. Readers can be found in both the summer afternoon sun or cuddling up during a blizzard, reading about everything from astrology to African history to arachnids, to abstract art.The store is now part of a bigger complex that uses the surrounding outbuildings to house independently owned businesses that complement the book store: an artist studio, a record store, an antique seller, a restaurant, and an adjoining café whose huge windows overlook the rushing waterfall.",Books you don’t need in a place you can’t find. ,"Deerfield Massacre Mass Grave,New England Peace Pagoda,The Rock and Fossil and Dinosaur Shop ","440 Greenfield Rd Montague, Massachusetts, 01351 United States",42.5379,-72.5379,OutriderghostfilmwilliamdauphinpretendingtowriteBlindcolour,2010-06-01 00:00:00,"New England Peace Pagoda,Deerfield Massacre Mass Grave,The Rock and Fossil and Dinosaur Shop ,Poet's Seat Tower","Green Thumb,Cactus Joe's Blue Diamond Nursery,Huntsman & Sons,Curioporium",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-montague-book-mill-montague-massachusetts

Haines built his empire around his shoes, starting with the proceeds of his very first commission. He was well known for his outlandish advertisement gimmicks and dramatic advertising. By 1948, Haines was 73 years old and a millionaire. What was left for him to do but build a shoe house?Twenty-five feet long and 48 feet tall, the house is a simple structure of wood, wire and cement stucco, with ornate stained glass windows featuring - what else - shoes. The Haines Shoe House served as a three-dimensional interactive billboard of sorts for his Haines Shoe Company. It alerted drivers-by to the opportunity to purchase his shoes, simple work boots for $1.98.Haines also generously opened the doors of his unique structure to the elderly and newlyweds to spend free vacation time. Any couple married in a town that had one of his shoe stores was welcome to stay at the Shoe House on an all-expenses paid visit which included “a maid, cook, chauffeur and automobile at their disposal and the couple was outfitted from head to toe in new clothing donated by local stores.” Honeymooning couples had their chance to live like kings and queens in a fairy tale - though perhaps not quite the one they had mind.For the last 40 years the Shoe House has passed through the hands of many different owners, and even served a stint as an ice cream shop, despite the questionable idea of buying ice cream served from a shoe. The house has been renovated to portray the look and feel of the 40-50’s era when the Shoe House was built and holds a museum on the eccentric life of “Colonel” Mahlon N.

201,Wanamaker Building,"organs,shopping,stores,music,shops",1749,1020,"John Wanamaker did things a bit differently. Inspired by two great central markets, London’s Royal Exchange and Paris’ Les Halles, Wanamaker decided it was time to bring what would become one of the first department stores to America. He envisioned a grand shopping hall which would sell his already established menswear and would expand to sell woman’s clothing and dry goods.Not only did Wanamaker envision a new kind of shopping destination, he pioneered a new shopping experience as well. The first to use and enforce the phrase, “The customer is always right,” Wanamaker ran his store under the message of the golden rule. Employees were to be treated with respect by their superiors, and all were offered free medical care, recreational facilities, profit sharing plans, and pensions long before it became the standard.One of the most important things Wanamaker left to modern stores was the price tag. Before he popularized the use of set prices, stores relied on haggling. Wanamaker believed that if everyone was equal before God, then everyone should be equal before price. It seems obvious today, but it wasn’t until Wanamaker invented the price tag that it became the norm.Opened in 1877, the store was the first to use electrical lighting (in 1878) and the first to use a pneumatic tube system for transporting cash and documents (in 1880). By 1910, Wanamaker had begun updating his store, slowly phasing out the old Moorish facade that followed the Grand Depot styles of London and Paris, in favor of the lavish, Florentine style it still has today. The new building featured the incredible Wanamaker Organ, formerly the St. Louis World’s Fair pipe organ. Despite the organ’s imposing size, it was decided that it was not large enough to fill the Grand Court with it music, and was expanded by Wanamaker’s own staff of organ builders. After a period of a few years, the organ had become the largest in the world.Eventually, Wanamaker’s customers petered off to other department stores like Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, and after being sold from retailer to retailer for many years, has become a Macy’s itself. Thankfully, Wanamaker’s was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, and visitors to Macy’s can still marvel at one of the first department stores in America and the largest operating musical instrument in the world, the famous Wanamaker organ, which is played every day except Sunday.Happily, even Wanamaker himself couldn’t put price tag on that.","The first American department store, and home to the largest operating musical instrument in the world. ","Masonic Temple of Philadelphia,Wanamaker Grand Court Organ,Philbert the Pig","1300 Market Street Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107 United States",39.9514,-75.1621,michellecait7911Collector of ExperiencesmbisonMattJCaseyJaszmina SzendreyMatthew H WardMattJCaseyccait7911Collector of ExperiencesargusfotoJaszmina Szendreymmbison,2009-10-27 00:00:00,"Wanamaker Grand Court Organ,Masonic Temple of Philadelphia,Philbert the Pig,Philadelphia City Hall","RONDO Distributing Co.,Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks,Robinson's Liberty Bells,Junkman's Daughter",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wanamaker-building
202,Corryvreckan Whirlpool ,"legends,geological oddities,water,geology",58,804,"A fierce whirlpool churns the waters between the Scottish islands of Jura and Scarba. Said to be the world’s third-largest whirlpool, it’s as legendary as it is impressive.Legends surround the whirlpool. One says the watery wonder was named after a Norwegian Prince who perished while trying to prove his love to a Scottish princess after her father gave him the risky task of keeping his boat in the whirlpool for three nights.Another legend tells of a nasty Irish pirate from Ulster who got his just desserts when the local sea witch saw into his heart as his ship sailed past. She conjured the whirlpool to protect Scotland from his nefarious ways and sent him to his doom. The real reason for the whirlpool’s existence is less fantastical, though no less interesting. The Gulf of Corryvreckan has giant rock pinnacle under the sea, which rises up to just 95 feet below the surface. It’s this obstruction that causes the whirlpool. Water is forced upward when it hits against the rock, causing huge, swirling waves. Sometimes in particularly stormy weather, the noise the whirlpool makes can be heard from 20 miles away.  The staggering current that travels over the pinnacle makes it a haven for filter-feeders like coral and sponges, as well as a variety of shellfish. This, in turn, draws larger animals like porpoises, dolphins, and whales to the area. ",Legend says a witch conjured the world's third largest whirlpool to protect Scotland from a nasty pirate. ,"Dunchraigaig Cairn and Baluachraig Rock Art,'The Unsoiling of Rockall',Kilmartin Glen Prehistoric Monuments",Gulf of Corryvreckan Scotland United Kingdom,56.1536,-5.7071,ssm67albadpreston48,2019-04-25 00:00:00,"'The Unsoiling of Rockall',Kilmartin Glen Prehistoric Monuments,Dunchraigaig Cairn and Baluachraig Rock Art,Ballymeanoch Prehistoric Monuments","Bufador de Peñiscola,Runaway Ghaut,St. Jacob's Well,Les Rochers du Carnaval",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corryvreckan-whirlpool
203,The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid,"statue,fairytales,statues,art",350,809,"Danish-Icelandic sculptor Edvard Eriksen’s “Little Mermaid” is one of Denmark’s most visited tourist attractions. The bronze statue, based on Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale of the same name, is as iconic to Copenhagen as the Statue of Liberty is to New York City. But it’s been a popular target for vandals over the years—she’s lost her head, twice. It’s an unfortunate state of affairs considering its origin: Brewer/philanthropist Carl Jacobsen commissioned the statue after being moved by a ballet production of the fairy tale. Bjørn Nørgaard’s Mermaid, on the other hand…In 2006, not quite 100 years after Eriksen’s iconic mermaid was introduced, Bjørn Nørgaard, a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, created “The Genetically Altered Paradise.” A news release described the piece as “a provocative and humorous look at postmodern society.” Located a quarter of a mile from the beloved tourist attraction are contorted, abstract sculptures of Adam, Eve, Mary Magdalene, Christ, a pregnant man, and “The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid.”This mermaid is also bronze and sits in a position similar to Eriksen’s, but her twisted figure, with elongated skeletal legs and an unrecognizable head, is a criticism of genetic alterations. The mermaid has avoided vandalism so far. Maybe it’s because, as Nørgaard says, she’s already “fighting against the order of nature”; any further modification would be superfluous.The statues, originally shown at the Danish pavilion at the Expo 2000 World’s Fair in Hanover, Germany, circle a sandstone arch topped with a 15-foot Madonna statue. They’re only a 10-minute walk from Erikson’s mermaid and, for those interested, offer a sobering alternative to his romanticism.",Hans Christian Andersen for the postmodern world. ,"The Little Mermaid,ZinkGlobal,Medical Museion",Langelinie Allé 17 Copenhagen Denmark,55.6984,12.5992,ZhabJohan SWELuis MoratohrnickTaterchipsbreaingramJohan SWETTaterchipsbreaingramCollector of ExperiencesLuis Moratohrnick,2017-08-10 00:00:00,"The Little Mermaid,ZinkGlobal,Medical Museion,Heisenberg's Bathtub","Scioto Lounge Deer Sculptures,Hans Christian Andersen Statue,'The Wave',Sotheby's Sekhmet",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-genetically-modified-little-mermaid-copenhagen-denmark

The basic idea behind the design was that the cells were all located on a central carousel that would, at the turning of a hand-crank, spin so that only one inmate’s holding area could be accessed at a time, via the single entryway. While most of the rotary jails built around this time had only one level of cells, the Council Bluffs jail was created with three stacked levels of holding cells. The combined effect of the tall cell structure made it look like the sort of cage one might hold a small animal in, hence its popular nickname.By the 1960s, the massive metal turntable was not faring so well and would frequently become stuck. The jail was in active use until 1969 when it finally closed its rotating doors to further criminals. After its closure, the jail was taken over by the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County and it was designated as a museum site.Today visitors to the historic mechanical jail can still come and inspect the once whirling hoosegow. Unfortunately the cage no longer turns, but the site is a fascinating look at one of the wilder innovations in modern incarceration.",The world's only three-story rotary jail is now a museum to a bizarre trend in prison design. ,"Golden Spike Monument,Lincoln Monument of Council Bluffs,Infield at the Zoo","226 Pearl Street Council Bluffs, Iowa, 51503 United States",41.2578,-95.8519,EricGrundhauserPushingUpDaisies,2015-04-09 00:00:00,"Lincoln Monument of Council Bluffs,Golden Spike Monument,Infield at the Zoo,Joslyn Castle","Jurassic Museum of Asturias,Pablo Fierro Museum,Missouri State Penitentiary,The Chapel of Our Lady ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pottawattamie-squirrel-cage-jail
205,The Burlington Arcade Beadles,"malls,police,shops",955,803,"The deluxe Burlington Arcade in the West End of London has been selling high-end luxury goods since 1819. Running from behind Bond Street to Piccadilly, it was the first shopping arcade to have a covered roof.  It was commissioned by Lord George Cavendish, “for the sale of jewelry and fancy articles of fashionable demand, for the gratification of the public.”With such a concentrated collection of luxury shops, Lord Cavendish saw a need to protect them from the criminal elements of London society, and with the Metropolitan police force still, a decade away he created his own. Called the Burlington Arcade Beadles they are the world’s oldest and smallest private police force. Incredibly, they are still in existence today. Drawn from retired members of his former army regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, the original Beadles were veterans of the Battle of Waterloo. Dressed today as they were in 1819, the Beadles still patrol the Burlington Arcade in traditional top hats and Victorian frock coats designed by Henry Poole of Saville Row. Lord Cavendish owned the Burlington House next door and ordered architect Samuel Ware to cover the roof of the arcade to stop ruffians from throwing oyster shells over the wall and into his garden. From such humble beginnings, the modern day shopping mall began. At nearly 100 yards long with a glass ceiling, the two-story arcade was home to 47 tenants. Of these, at least six were recorded as being “industrious females.” Today the beautiful glass-covered shopping street is still home to some of the most exclusive shops in London. Art dealers, high-end watches, jewelers, and dealers in antique silver. Hancock’s, occupiers of number 52, designed and created the original Victoria Cross, the United Kingdom’s highest decoration for valor and bravery, “in the face of the enemy.” All 1,358 VC’s ever awarded have been made by the prestigious tenant of the Burlington Arcade.Today the Burlington Arcade remains as exclusive as it was in Victorian times. The industrious females may be long gone from the upstairs rooms, but the street-long collection of high-end luxury shops still do a thriving business and are still protected by their own private police force, just as they were nearly 200 years ago. ",This luxury shopping lane has been protected by its own tiny police force for over a century. ,"Michael Faraday's Laboratory,K2 Telephone Boxes ,A Geological Map of England and Wales and Part of Scotland","London, England United Kingdom 51.5090, -0.1402Book a hotel on Kayak Visit Website NearbyK2 Telephone Boxes 0.03 milesA Geological Map of England and Wales and Part of Scotland0.07 milesMichael Faraday's Laboratory0.09 miles",51.509,-0.1402,Luke J SpencerSEANETTACollector of ExperiencesMark MonesharotradGavinJJulius SpadahharotradjooniurGavinMMark Monesreley250Collector of ExperiencesSEANETTAhrnickphiloursmars,2015-03-10 00:00:00,"K2 Telephone Boxes ,A Geological Map of England and Wales and Part of Scotland,Michael Faraday's Laboratory,Huntsman & Sons","Temple Ehécatl ,Fábrica La Aurora,Plaza Loreto,Garden Santa Fe",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-burlington-arcade-beadles-london-england

The ornate marble and limestone complex was remarkably constructed in just 16 months by a supernaturally dedicated group of 1,700 volunteers, using no steel support in the entire building. The speedy construction feat was achieved by quarrying the stone from such disparate countries as Turkey and Italy, then shipping the raw rocks to India for carving. The delicate and ornate stonework was then carved in India for 22 months prior to being shipped out to Bartlett where the pieces were put together like the most expensive Lego set of all time.The beautiful ivory building features five carved pinnacles surrounding a central dome, all spread across the huge central building. Despite the tall, sprawling structure there is not an inch of the temple that seems to be free of some sort of carving or filigree giving the building an unreal fantasy feel.The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Sanstha Mandir seems as though someone simply created a portal to India on the outskirts of Chicago. To complete the effect, the mandir also features an adjoining cultural center known as a “haveli” which was also created to religious specifications, although using wood.

The former Spanish textile worker had actually been in opposition to the government for over 30 years, since he began working on creating his own amazing city out of natural landscape.In 1980, Pujiula i Vila began by crafting a labyrinth alongside the Fluvia, a river in Catalonia, Spain. After creating his initial labyrinth, he began to make other structures in the area as well. Pujiula made towers out of branches and trees stretching 30 meters into the air. He coiled wood into tube-like tunnels and walkways and he even made a small livable cabin.As his world grew,  the community took notice. Families came there with their children to solve the labyrinth and wander through the woodsy environment. Sadly, there were not only curious visitors to his creation. Along with wonderstruck children and their parents, came homeless people sleeping in the cabin, vandals and worst of all, the Spanish government.Inspecting the area, which was built on public land, the government quickly deemed Pujiula i Vila’s homemade park a dangerous environment. Over growing concern for visitor safety, he was pushed toward dismantling his work. Although safety was seen as a pretext for government action on the land, officials also wanted to use the land to create a new highway.In 2002, they got their wish and Pujiula i Vila took apart his creation to make room for government roads. While he was beaten by the government fair and square, he refused to give up. Shortly after, he began to create a similar site near his previous work.Although not quite as grand as his wonderland, he never gave up on his dream. Slowly, he worked to rebuild it, and a masterful tubed walkway and tower stand as a monument to his perseverance and architectural skill.Pujiula i Vila passed in June 2016. Since, some of his works have been taken down. The labyrinth still retains many fantastical tower structures, walkways, and tunnels full of creepy items and carvings. ",Wonderland replication in progress by one persistent man. ,"Castellfollit de la Roca,Hermitage of Santa Margarita Crater,Besalu Micromundi Museum of Miniatures ","A-26 Argelaguer, 17853 Spain",42.2155,2.6316,serflacatimianblackdogjacobjmasLominehphillthorpeMathias Van de VeldejjacobjmasphillthorpeLLominehbblackdogatimian,2011-08-10 00:00:00,"Besalu Micromundi Museum of Miniatures ,Castellfollit de la Roca,Hermitage of Santa Margarita Crater,Bosc de Can Ginebreda","Mosaic House of Dunedin,Enchanted Hart Haus ,Castillo Monumento Colomares,The Chapel of Jimmy Ray",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/laberinth-of-josep-pujiula

This is the Toledo metro station, the crowning jewel of the “Art Stations” of the Naples Metro.The Art Stations project (Stazioni dell’Arte) entrusted the vision of the city’s public transit stations to contemporary artists and architects in order to bring art to people’s everyday lives. The dazzling Toledo underground station stands out among the bunch, and was even nominated as the most beautiful transit station in Europe.Each level of the station is designed around a different color representing a different theme related to the city. The walls and floor of the atrium on the first level are black, recalling the asphalt of contemporary civilization. The remains of Aragonese walls are also integrated into the atrium, which is adorned with mosaics inspired by the history of Naples.As you descend down the escalator, the walls become ochre and yellow, alluding to the colors of Neapolitan tuff and the sun.

The light atop the church tower, which has since been replaced with a lighted cross, served as a nautical landmark to guide boats safely home. It also served to illuminate the tower’s unintended feature: that it happens to resemble a giant chicken from multiple points of view.Today the nondenominational church remains a landmark and a hub of community life.

Currently an antique store, it is a mecca for those who love old stuff, enjoy decrepitude-induced shivers, or any combination thereof.  Commenced in 1860 by the man who shares its name, the Noble Hardee Mansion looks down and out on Monterey Square. Completed in 1869, it claims the distinction of visits from genial — and utterly forgettable — US President Chester A. Arthur.

In the design and construction, they let their imaginations run wild, taking inspiration from both French and Nordic architectural traditions. Some of the more eccentric flourishes they added include an 11-foot-tall stain glass window; tons of rough-carved woodwork; a “Norman village” outdoor balcony; a wall-ceiling-wall relief mural featuring seagulls, built-in floral wall sconces and Viking ships; and odd, asymmetrical entrance arches.The singular home was sold in 1979 and began being rented out, like so many homes in LA, to aspiring actors and screenwriters. In the 1993, two aspiring screenwriters, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, began living in the home where they famously penned their breakthrough Good Will Hunting screenplay. Affleck was familiar with the area, as he had studied at nearby Occidental College.Today, the house is a private residence and is popular as a TV/film location. The recently released pop-horror film Ouija House was filmed here, with the house itself receiving title billing. It received historic-cultural monument status (#1042) by the City of Los Angeles in 2013, and they claimed it had nothing to do with the Good Will Hunting connection. ",The house where Good Will Hunting was written is a surreal fairytale abode. ,"Bob Baker Marionette Theater,The Moore Lab of Zoology ,Adams Square Mini Park","2327 Hill Drive Los Angeles, California, 90041 United States",34.1438,-118.2169,daviddellingerjulnyesnathanlouis1haydesigner,2015-08-07 00:00:00,"The Moore Lab of Zoology ,Bob Baker Marionette Theater,Adams Square Mini Park,Eagle Rock","Conanicut Island Lighthouse,A Christmas Story House and Museum,Sculptured House ,Ennis House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/egasse-braasch-house

While there are pieces of art scattered all over the island, the center of the project is considered to be the Tadao Ando designed museum and hotel that make up the Bennesse complex.Naoshima’s history, even when summarized probably a bit too concisely, is inspiring. In the 1980’s the chairman of Fukutake Publishing began looking for a home for their corporate art collection. Rather than build a museum in Tokyo, the chairman wondered if the islands he remembered from his youth might benefit from the influx of an artistic economy. Mineral resources, once the lifeblood of the islands were no longer profitable and the islands’ youth were leaving behind the remaining careers such as fishing and moving to bigger cities, all culminating in a depressed economy. Luckily a mayor from the island region reached out to the chairman and, over time, a plan evolved.  To kick start the artistic revolution in the area, the great architect Tadao Ando was contracted to design the beginnings of a complex of museums that were quite dramatic on the inside, but surprisingly subtle on the outside, partially concealed by the surrounding land.This high profile project led to new commissions of site-specific works, especially in the town of Naoshima. The corporation, now known as Bennesse, created a foundation that runs the ever increasing amount of modern art that is on display in the town.There are certain pieces and experiences designed for hotel guests only, but there is much more that is open to all. Special attention should be paid to the fisherman’s houses in the port area, the sculptures on the grounds of the Bennesse Museum/Hotel and the Chichu Art Museum, dedicated to three different artists.",A Japanese corporation has turned this small island town into living modern art gallery. ,"Matsuka Seimen Noodle Factory,Washuzan Highland,Mt.

At the time, Fitzgerald was working on his novel Tender is the Night, as well as a screenwriting job on Red-Headed Woman, a Jean Harlow movie. In January, 1932, Zelda had a mental collapse which led her to a Baltimore clinic. Scott and Scottie remained in the home through April of that year.Slated for destruction in 1986, Julian and Leslie McPhillips saved the home and established the Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum Association, opening it to the public the following year. Zelda was from Montgomery, which led the couple to return there a number of times. The Felder house is the last surviving home in Montgomery either Scott or Zelda lived in.The main entrance to the house leads into a small foyer, with doors to the right and left, and stairs going up. The museum itself occupies the first floor, with private apartments above. These apartments now serve as AirBnB locations, the Zelda and Scott Suites, where you can book to stay the night.

Like something out of a fairy tale, the park’s main attraction is the “Chambers of Wonder” exhibition, which is contained within a green hill, the entrance of which is made to look like a crouching giant. The exhibition itself consists of over a dozen different rooms decked out in Swarovski crystals, creating uniquely themed, glittering spaces that could just as easily be a dwarf king’s treasure hall.In 2015, the park was given a facelift and expanded to almost double the original size.

Another replica of Gustav Eiffel’s Parisian masterwork was unveiled that same year in Paris, Tennessee, standing just about five feet taller than the Texas monument. Since the Texas tower was being billed as the “Second Largest Eiffel Tower in the Second Largest Paris” this was a bit of a problem.In 1998 an independent group of investors devised a plan to somewhat rectify the discrepancy. Put a cowboy hat on it. Thus a huge metal cowboy hat was installed atop the tower, tipped ever so coolly back to push the ten-foot-diameter brim a bit higher. Of course the whole thing became a forgone issue after the Paris hotel in Las Vegas built their 541 foot imitation.Even without the height rivalry, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Texas certainly remains the most American of the remakes.

218,The Flintstone House,"domes,outsider architecture,eccentric homes,houses,homes",649,802,"Drivers heading north to San Francisco on Interstate 280 will notice a peculiar home just east of the Eugene A. Doran Memorial Bridge. The house, playfully dubbed by Bay Area residents as The Flintstone House, is actually an experimental house built in 1976 with rooms in which every surface is rounded. Beneath its burnt orange (originally white) coat of paint is a slew of cement, rebar, plaster putty, wire mesh, and aeronautical balloons.The house looks somewhat like a series of inflated balloons, which makes sense, as this was how it was constructed. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were constructed over large inflated balloons and then sprayed with high-velocity concrete known as gunite or “shotcrete.”This building technique, known as “monolithic dome construction,” was invented by the South brothers in Shelly, Idaho, in 1975. One year later, Bay Area architect William Nicholson built a series of domes using this method, including The Flintstone House in Hillsborough, California.The home, which is also referred to as the Dome House, Gumby House, Worm Casting House and, Bubble House, is a three-bedroom, two-bath house with a two-car garage and about 2,700 square feet of living space. The upstairs bedroom, located in the tallest dome, has a spiral staircase inspired by a sugar cone with a diameter that increases to equal that of the floor above. The master bathroom is also unique, with its scattering of large rocks in place of floor tiles.While The Flintstone House is marveled at by many passersby, it’s also loathed by many Hillsborough residents. In the mid-1980s, the home began to show serious wear as water runoff on the steep hillside caused it to sink and the walls began to develop deep cracks. Word spread of such problems and several neighbors pushed to have the home removed. However, to their dismay, a severe renovation and change in ownership brought the home back to life in 1987. It took on its characteristic “Flintstone” look when it was painted completely orange in 2000.Today, The Flintstone House is as well known for its architecture as it is for its sporadic tenants, which has led to several urban legends surrounding the home’s ownership. It’s rumored that George Lucas once owned the house. It’s also said that several famous Silicon Valley investors have lived there as well.Regardless of ownership and neighborhood complaints, The Flintstone House remains standing. Overlooking the freeway and reservoir, it continues to serve as an unofficial California landmark and a lighthearted reminder of the Bay Area’s forward, yet sometimes quirky, thinking.The property was purchased in 2017 by octogenarian Florence Fang, who made several whimsical additions to the home, including anodized steel dinosaurs and “Flintstones” characters in the yard which are visible to passing motorists on Interstate 280. In 2019, the wealthy, snobbish residents of the town of Hillsborough attempted legal action to have the statues removed.

Sadly, the outer walls have not survived the ages as well as the castle.Fiddaun Castle was built around 1574 and is remarkably preserved—the only things missing from it are the outer walls and the attic, or top story. It is best known for its incredibly intact inner walls, or bawn. They still stand around the tower house with climbable steps and walkable defenses. Though the castle has been empty for hundreds of years, it is also intact and you can explore every floor, corner, and even the rooftop if you can traverse the incredibly narrow and slippery spiral staircase. This makes it an unusual and slightly dangerous treat that you can explore at will.Fiddaun is on private land and maintained by the Department of Public Works.

Capp allowed the use of his characters and ideas at the park on the condition that the rustic atmosphere of Lil’ Abner’s fictional town (which gives the park its name) not be lost beneath garish rides and spectacle. The attractions, which opened in 1968 included a fudge shop, horseback riding, paddle boats, and other low-impact, family-friendly activities. Capp’s characters such as Daisy Mae and Hairless Joe also roamed the grounds performing backwoods comedy routines. The jewel of the park was an oversized statue of Jubilation T. Cornpone, the fictional hero of the town. Outside consultants projected that the park would attract 400,000 people in its first year alone, however the park would never attract half that many people.The park changed hands a number of times and lost much of its original backwoods themes in the years before its final closure in 1993. After the park closed, the grounds and remaining attractions were left to rot and the future of the land was uncertain. The owners actually attempted to sell the entire site on eBay for a flat million dollars, but once again the interest in the park may have been misguided as there were no bidders. In 2005 the land was awarded to a young man who nearly decapitated himself on the property in an ATV accident, but it is currently being parceled out to buyers with an interest in revitalizing the ruins.

Originally the secluded shelf was home to a hermitage where holy men could come for silent reflection, completely removed from the rest of the world. The actual church was built in 1530 and the site became a chapel for anyone wanting to pay pilgrimage and contemplate the nature of God in peace. The main chapel saw a number of changes over the ensuing centuries growing larger and at one point having a larger church built over the existing one. Thanks to its relative inaccessibility the church was never totally destroyed or desecrated and managed to survive into the 20th century, crumbling a bit but intact. In the 1970s an Italian architect tore down much of the aging structure and built it back up, taking care to retain as many important artistic flourishes as possible.Today the once treacherous mountain path to the chapel has been modernized and the remarkable church is still a popular pilgrimage site for visitors coming to see the Scala Santa, a replica of the stairs to Pilate’s palace that Jesus ascended before he was condemned to be crucified.

It was used as a real estate office at one time to sell plots of land to “Lake Havasu Estates.” The developers went so far as to send out promotional materials for the homes they hoped to construct showing happy would-be residents waterskiing and enjoying other amenities that were never to be built. The project was a classic scam and a couple people served time in prison for it.After sitting empty for years, new owners eventually purchased the structure, spent a significant amount of money renovating it, built a store on the property, and named it Area 66.

Representing the farthest known exploration on the part of the Vikings, L’Anse aux Meadows is a made up of eight simple buildings made of sod over wooden frames.This settlement is thought to be the fabled Vinland, a place immortalized in Viking sagas as a distant outpost. L’anse aux Meadows would have been used as a stopping-over point to restock food and provisions before exploring further west, probably New Brunswick, or traveling east back to Greenland. Some believe that the Vikings may have made it as far into North America as the Great Lakes, though evidence of this is scant.The Viking buildings are widely thought to be either homes or workshops, and many are related to iron working, carpentry and boat repair. Archaeological evidence indicates that it was in use for about 15 years before it was abandoned. Whether they left due to weather, food, boredom, or were chased off by the Indigenous peoples is unknown, but it seems like they didn’t leave in haste, and took most valuables with them. The sagas about Vinland suggest that North American exploration was halted after relations soured with the Dorset or pre-Beothuk inhabitants.In order to protect the site, the Canadian government buried the excavation in white sand and covered it with sod. They built replicas of the buildings nearby, with a boardwalk surrounding. The climate at the site is sub-Arctic, and icebergs can be seen off the coast in June and July, as can whales.The building frames are laid out with signage to indicate what each space was used for. The replica spaces have costumed interpreters, highly skilled in a number of crafts and knowledgeable about the lifestyle the original occupants likely led.

Before the hospital started using anesthesia in 1846, the primary tool of the surgeon was speed. Patients were generously given a choice of opium, liquor, or a knock on the head with a mallet to render them unconscious.Within the walls of Philadelphia’s expanded, modern Pennsylvania Hospital is the original hospital, founded in 1751 by Ben Franklin and Dr. Thomas Bond. The Pine building, in addition to having a beautiful medical library (featuring 13,000 books and a series of plaster anatomical casts) holds the original surgery amphitheater. Built in 1804 and used until 1868, the operating theater is the oldest in the United States. The building of the amphitheater helped formalize surgery and turn it into a recognized medical discipline.

But it’s the 12 stone-carved angel statues surrounding his tomb that are truly breathtaking.The winged statues are mounted against the pillars of the crypt. Cloaked in draping clothing, all appear to have a shocked, unbelieving look on their faces. Many suggest the angels serve as guardians for Napoleon’s grave, while others believe they helped guide him to the heavens.The life-sized white marble figures were actually designed to symbolize the general’s military achievements. The “Victories” are the final work of French sculptor Jean Jacques Pradier, who is renowned for his neoclassical works found at the Triomphe Arc de Triumph and the Louvre. (Pradier was laid to rest at Paris’ famous Père Lachaise cemetery).  While Napoleon’s angels are a special treat for the eyes, the entire building is beautiful.

Today it includes the Musée de l’Armée French military museum, and the Dôme des Invalides, a former chapel inspired by St. Peter’s in Rome. Several French war heroes are entombed here, as well as members of Napoleon’s family, including his son, the King of Rome.Though Napoleon Bonaparte died in exile in Longwood, Saint Helena in 1821, his body wasn’t interred at Les Invalides until 1861.

This place was described to him as a mecca of human understanding, togetherness, and art. Before departing the beings instructed Owens to “return to Georgia and do something.” After his vision, Owens moved back to Georgia as instructed, began calling himself St. EOM, and took to founding Pasaquan.Beginning around 1955 and funding his dream with fortune telling gigs, St. EOM succeeded in creating six buildings covered in his colorfully detailed artwork across seven acres of land, the oldest of the structures being a 19th century farmhouse that he turned into a dizzying kaleidoscope of designs. Each of the buildings is covered, inside and out in mandalas, designs, faces, and other hand-painted artworks from nature and beyond. Each of the buildings is linked by concrete walls that are also covered in the psychedelic designs. Unfortunately St. EOM took his own life in 1986 leaving Pasaquan assumedly unfinished. After his death, Pasaquan’s visionary artworks were in danger of being left to the elements or destroyed for the land but luckily the site fell to a group known as the Pasaquan Preservation Society who were able to get the compound marked as a historic landmark and are now beginning full restoration of the site.

The large estate house featured intricate detailing across the exterior including gabled roofs and picketed red spokes across the spacious porch. The interior of the home had rooms for his wife and all of his children, and a number of rooms devoted to luxury space. The interior was designed with input from Twain and featured an idiosyncratic layout. It is even rumored that the house was built to resemble a riverboat, although this is not readily apparent.While he lived in the house, Twain penned many of his most successful works including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. His time a the Connecticut house were some of his happiest, but they were not to last.After losing a great deal of his money by investing in a shoddy printing press, Twain and his family were forced to move to Europe in 1891. Later on when Twain’s fortunes once again turned, one of daughters passed away. The memory of the lost child was too much for Twain’s wife and she was unable to return to their Connecticut home. Thus the grand house was sold.Today the house has been marked a national landmark and has been restored to the opulent condition it was in when inhabited by Twain and his family.

In collaboration with the Exploratorium, artist Peter Richards built an acoustic sculpture that amplifies the sounds of the waves in the bay.The organ’s jetty was constructed with carved granite and marble from a demolished cemetery. Magnificently old and finely worked pieces form the irregular terraced seating and even a trash can holder. The instrument itself is comprised of more than 20 PVC and concrete pipes that extend down into the water at various elevations. The sound is created by waves crashing against the ends of these pipes. When the waves roll in, the pipes resound with liquid music: low, gurgling notes that ebb and flow with the restless movement of the ocean and the changing of the tides.What makes the music? It is similar to the phenomena of the sound heard in a conch shell—a specific volume of air resonating at a specific frequency. The same sort of thing happens in the pipes of the Wave Organ, but there is one important difference. In the Wave Organ, the columns of air within the pipes constantly change as the water moves in and out, and as the length and volume of the air column in each pipe changes, the pitch of the sound it produces also varies. The larger the volume of air, the lower the sound; the smaller the volume of air, the higher the sound.The park-like setting on the lee side of the breakwater has a view of San Francisco’s Marina District, downtown San Francisco’s skyline, the East Bay hills, Sausalito, Mt. Tamalpais, the Presidio, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Marin Headlands.

They built two nine-story towers side-by-side, and enclosed a five-story arcade beneath a 300-foot-long glass skylight.When it opened in 1890, the bright, ornate interior was one of the first indoor shopping malls in America, a place where Cleveland shoppers could find respite from Lake Effect snow and summer heat waves.

Gold, himself, though started it. The hot dog stand stays open ‘til 5am on the weekends and attracts hungry customers from the local bars. From the beginning, in the wealthy Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, the customers were not always the nicest or most attentive. One night in 1992, Gold was trying to get a patron’s attention, and, when typical pleas didn’t work, Gold yelled out, “Hey asshole.”In the years since, the name-calling and yelling has escalated, as the mainly black staff has been provoked by their white and wealthy clientele, who, in some ways, must enjoy being called names. In a city as segregated as Chicago, racial tensions can run high, and, on rare occasions, things get physical.

238,Radio City Music Hall's Secret Apartment,"art deco,hidden,eccentric homes,homes",212,1014,"Radio City Music Hall is one of the jewels in New York’s art deco crown.Since it opened in 1932, over 300 million visitors to the “show place of the nation” have marveled at its breathtaking elegance. Designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone and interior designer Donald Deskey, Radio City is a gilded palace of luxurious drapes, gold leaf, bakelite detailing, and beautiful murals.The man charged with replicating the building’s magnificence on stage was theatre impresario Samuel “Roxy” Rothafel. Roxy’s nickname had become a byword in opulence, glamour, and entertainment; Cole Porter’s hit song from Anything Goes, “You’re the Top,” went so far as to say, “You’re romance, you’re the steppes of Russia, you’re the pants on a Roxy usher.” His eponymous Roxy film theatre in Times Square, sadly demolished in 1960, was known as the “cathedral of motion pictures.” Roxy gave Radio City his magic touch, producing thrilling and ground breaking shows. He introduced synchronized orchestral scores to silent films, and audiences flocked to what was at the time the world’s largest indoor theatre to see the latest film releases paired with his glittering troupe of dancing Rockettes. According to legend and to show their appreciation for his talents, Stone and Deskey decided to give Roxy a present. High up inside Radio City, they built him an apartment. As lavishly detailed in the art deco style as the theatre downstairs, Roxy wined and dined such leading lights as Olivia de Havilland, Samuel Goldwyn, and Alfred Hitchcock there. With 20 foot high ceilings covered in gold leaf, and walls decorated floor to ceiling with plush drapes, Roxy’s apartment was as mesmerizing as his opulent stages shows below.After Roxy died in 1936 the apartment lay unused and forgotten, hidden away far above the audiences he used to entertain. No one lives there now, but it remains in pristine condition. Today Roxy’s apartment (now known as the Roxy Suite) is available for hire for luxury events. So the next time you want to sip cocktails under the same golden ceiling as the leading lights of the 1930s did, Radio City Music Hall has the perfect glittering apartment, secreted away high above its famous stage.","Built as a gift to the hottest tastemaker of the time, these hidden quarters remain an Art Deco showpiece. ","Central Filing Bar,Spotlight on Broadway Map,Israel Miller's 'Show Folks Shoe Shop' Building","Radio City Music Hall 1260 6th Avenue New York, New York, 10020",40.7606,-73.9823,Luke J SpencerMolly McBride JacobsonbreaingramMike Hajbelongialittlebrumble,2013-10-13 00:00:00,"Central Filing Bar,Israel Miller's 'Show Folks Shoe Shop' Building,Spotlight on Broadway Map,6 1/2 Avenue: Manhattan's Secret Street","Villa Rose ,Harvington Hall,Shelton McMurphey Johnson House,Polychrome Historic District",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/radio-city-music-hall-s-secret-apartment

Like its funky and full-of-flair original space, the current shop lures locals with an array of  vibrant signage. From painted pink frying pans that together read “OPEN” to a teal and white banner promising “Spices, Art, Music,” the building’s brightly-colored facade radiates its French Quarter roots. Inside, the lemon yellow walls are covered with art and knickknacks, from paintings to dinner plates to beer bottles. From the ceiling, Christmas lights form low-hanging arcs across the room with strips of diaphanous tulle and 1950s aprons to keep them company.The shop blossoms with the eclectic: cookbooks, new and old, from near and far, and many with handwritten notes between the covers or swooping signatures by authors and chefs. Books such as Gumbo Tales, La Bouche Creole, and Real Cajun are but a few of their special collection exploring the culinary history and offerings of Acadiana (that’s Cajun country). In addition to cookbooks, an array of vinyl records, old-school cookware, and homemade Creole spice blends are available for purchase. Meanwhile, the bookstore and its expansive parking lot often act as a pop-up location and community space for readings, meetings, and, of course, regular feasting.Philipe LaMancusa, a former chef, is responsible for the collection of some 11,000 books. Prior to opening Kitchen Witch, he landed in New Orleans to work at the well-known Commander’s Palace alongside Paul Prudhomme, a famous chef who also happens to be the author of one of the store’s bestselling cookbooks, Louisiana Kitchen. But Philipe couldn’t resist his attraction to the literary, however, and with nudging from his partner, Debbie Lindsey, they decided to open their own shop, which they did just three months after Hurricane Katrina. In the time since, many locals have visited Kitchen Witch, looking for rare titles lost in the flood and finding in the worn stacks the books that have helped them rebuild their homes.Update as of September 2019: Kitchen Witch Cookbooks has closed its doors.","This colorful New Orleans bookstore features rare and used titles, with a specialty in Cajun fare. ","St. Ann's Shrine and Grotto,Edgar Degas House,Dooky Chase's Restaurant","1452 N Broad St C New Orleans, Louisiana United States",29.9768,-90.0771,Leigh ChavezBushbrookesheree,2018-11-14 00:00:00,"Edgar Degas House,St. Ann's Shrine and Grotto,Dooky Chase's Restaurant,General Laundry Building","Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks,Joanne Hendricks Cookbooks,Morris Press Cookbook Store,Booked Up",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kitchen-witch-cookbooks
241,World's Largest Puffin Colony,"children,world's largest,birds,islands,animals",242,1012,"Iceland is home to around half of all the world’s puffins. The Westman Islands, which host the world’s largest puffin colony, are a haven for the country’s iconic birds.There are over 1.1 million puffin burrows buried beneath the soil on the chain of islands. From late April to late summer the birds pepper the cliffs and meadows. During this time, around 20 percent of the world’s entire puffin population breeds and raises its young here.It’s an annual tradition for children of Heimaey, the archipelago’s only inhabited island, to form “pysja patrols” to rescue lost and disoriented young puffins (which they call pysjas) that have wandered from their nests. The kids scoop up the confused birds and bring them home for the night. They then release them back into the wild. The pysja patrols save thousands of adolescent puffins every year.Beyond the pysja patrols, puffins further are ingrained within life on Heimaey. Puffin images feature on murals and advertisements. Even the street signs are modeled after the orange-beaked birds.Until the population began to rapidly decline in the 2000s, locals hunted them as a traditional food source. The population has since started to rebound, to the joy of the islanders who consider the birds an important part of their culture.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

A new industrial center is expected to open by 2017.Chicago was once known as the “World’s Candy Capital” and the massive plant that earned the city that name still stands, but it has been years since it produced any sweets, instead sitting abandoned and rotting, moving farther and farther from its sugary beginnings.The historic Brach’s candy company built their giant Chicago factory in 1923 in order to meet the ever-growing demand for their confections, spending $5 million dollars (an almost unheard of amount in those days) on the complex. When the giant plant was finished, the company was able to produce more than 250 different types of treats and for a time seemed as though they were a candy juggernaut too big to fail. Surviving the Great Depression, a deadly explosion in the 1940s, and an ever changing taste in candy, it was not until the early 2000s that the factory met its match. It was sugar itself that was the downfall of the huge factory as the cost of domestic sugar went through the roof in the 80s and 90s making the giant candy operation unsustainable in the US.In 2003 the plant finally closed, locking its doors and leaving the sprawling operation empty. While the fate of the huge space was decided, the factory simply began to fall apart with paint peeling and metal rusting under years of neglect. One portion of the plant was finally used in the movie The Dark Knight when it stood in for a hospital that was blown up in 2007.     The rest of the plant continues to stand today with constant plans to tear it down being talked about and slowly getting underway, but for now it is a reminder of a time when Chicago was an even sweeter city.  Illinois Week on Atlas Obscura was created in partnership with Enjoy Illinois as part of the launch of the new Illinois Obscura Society. Sign up to find out more about the back room tours, unusual adventures, and incredible parties that Atlas Obscura will be putting on in Chicago and greater Illinois.","What was once one of the country's largest confectionary plants is now an abandoned ruin, but is still pretty sweet. ","Walt Disney's Chicago Birthplace,Busy Beaver Button Co.,Garfield Park Conservatory","401 North Cicero Ave Chicago, Illinois, 60644 United States",41.8889,-87.7419,EricGrundhausersinginlady2001Collector of ExperiencesPrestonWleannditterrickdrewleanndittersinginlady2001Collector of ExperiencesrrickdrewMMartinPPrestonW,2015-02-19 00:00:00,"Garfield Park Conservatory,Walt Disney's Chicago Birthplace,Busy Beaver Button Co.,Ernest Hemingway Birthplace and Museum","The Gas Station,Tower of Chia,Film City,The Old Place Restaurant ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-brach-s-candy-factory
243,Kintai Bridge,"cultures and civilizations,architectural oddities,architecture",160,1014,"A historical wooden arch bridge in the city of Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, the Kintai Bridge was built in 1673. With a series of five wooden arches, the bridge spans the Nishiki River. It is located at the foot of Mt. Yokotama, which is topped with the famous Iwakuni Castle. The castle was built in 1601 and overlooked a series of wooden bridges, all destroyed by spring floods before the Kintai bridge was completed.The elegance of the bridge’s form inspired the name Kintai, which means gold brocade sash because of a similarity to the traditional Nishiki obi for a kimono. It has been rebuilt several times since it was initially constructed even though it was thought to be indestructible, most recently in 1951 after a typhoon. The bridge is made up of five arches standing atop four stone piers as well as two wood piers that sit on the dry riverbed where the bridge begins and ends. For almost three hundred years, the bridge stood without the use of nails that you would find in more traditional construction. It stood because all of its many pieces were very carefully fitted together. Sheets of copper were laid over the main wooden parts of the bridge after it was built.Kintai remains Japan’s most famous bridge. Tourists cross it on foot to visit samurai family-owned houses in Kikko Park, and take a cable car to the heights to visit Iwakuni Castle, and to see a breathtaking panorama of Iwakuni and the Seto Sea. Declared a National Treasure in 1922, the area including both the bridge and the castle is one of the country’s most popular destinations, especially during the Cherry Blossom festival in the spring.","One of Japan's most famous sights, the bridge was originally built in 1673. ","Itsukushima Shrine,Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine,World's Largest Rice Scoop",Kintai Bridge Kikko Park Iwakuni,34.1666,132.2188,Nicholas Jackson,2011-03-29 00:00:00,"Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine,Itsukushima Shrine,World's Largest Rice Scoop,Hiroshima Peace Memorial","Chin Tsong Palace,Fordlândia,The Drowned Church of Potosi,Shibam",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kintai-bridge

Created by sculptor Robert Berks, the head is modeled on a bust that the artist sculpted at the scientist’s home in Princeton in the 1950s. The giant bronze genius is relaxed, holding a tablet that sketches out three of his most important scientific contributions: the photoelectric effect, the theory of general relativity, and the equivalence of energy and matter.Einstein was elected to the NAS in 1922, a year after he won the Nobel Prize in physics. His citizenship at the time is a little complicated (he was naturalized Swiss but German-born, and also claimed by the Weimar Republic), and since only U.S. citizens can be elected as full members, he entered as a “Foreign Associate.” In 1940 he became a citizen of the United States, and two years later was elected as a full member, serving the NAS mission until his death in 1955.The NAS is a private, nonprofit organization of scientists, engineers, and doctors, created to provide “independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology.” It’s fitting that it is also within sight of the Lincoln Memorial—the agency was created by Congress in the middle of the Civil War, in an act signed by President Lincoln himself.Rumor has it if you rub Einstein’s nose some of his genius will rub off on you.",The beloved statue at the National Academy of Sciences is oh so inviting to sit on. ,"National Academy of Sciences,Federal Reserve Tennis Court,State Department Protocol Gift Office","2103-2199 US-50 Washington, District of Columbia, 20418 United States",38.8924,-77.0484,SuzieFgmclarkamtneerpribshrnickCollector of ExperiencesttaylsliottaCollector of ExperiencesppribsaamtneerggmclarkrrobertjoynotoriousFIGBlindcolourhrnick,2016-10-20 00:00:00,"National Academy of Sciences,State Department Protocol Gift Office,Federal Reserve Tennis Court,Lincoln Memorial Undercroft","Daguerre Monument,Josie Lyon Statue and Grave,Le Petit Tambour,Silent Witness Memorial",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albert-einstein-bronze-statue
245,Catacombes de Paris,"ossuaries,memento mori,catacombs and crypts,subterranean sites",4455,7057,"In 2004, Parisian police were assigned to do a training exercise in a previously uncharted part of the Catacombs of Paris beneath the Palais de Chaillot. Entering the catacombs through a drain, officers first came across a sign that read “Building site, no access,” and a bit further in, a camera that actively recorded images of those who passed. As the officers approached the camera, a recording of dogs barking was triggered.The police descended deeper into the tunnels and discovered a 500-square-meter cavern with a fully equipped cinema. It included a giant cinema screen, projection equipment, chairs and a handful of films, from film noir classics to recent thrillers. Someone had turned this abandoned underground cavern into a secret amphitheater. Aside from this, in the next “room,” police discovered a fully-stocked bar and restaurant, complete with tables and chairs. The discovery left police befuddled, not to mention the professional installation of electricity and three phone lines.Three days later, police returned with experts from the French Board of Electricity to try and figure out where the power was coming from. The cables had been cut and a note lying on the floor read, “Do not try and find us.”Quarry tunnels have existed on the outskirts of Paris since Roman times. The limestone in these quarries built Paris as we know it today, and eventually, helped the city expand to the point where the quarries were directly underneath the busy metropolis. Some 200 miles of labyrinthine tunnels are believed to exist.Despite the vast length of the tunneled, underground world, only a small section of it is open to the public. This tiny portion, known as Denfert-Rochereau Ossuary, or more popularly, “The Catacombs,” has become one of the top tourist attractions in Paris.The popular site houses the skeletal remains of some six to seven million former Parisians. Not all areas of the Catacombs are open to the public. Back in the late 18th century, cemeteries were becoming over-populated. Cemeteries such as Les Innocents were so stuffed with the dead that it led to improper burials, open graves, and unearthed corpses. Neighbors began getting sick with infectious diseases due to the unhealthy conditions of the cemetery.Les Innocents was not the only cemetery that was condemned. Many other graveyards were becoming overpopulated, causing problems for the inhabitants of Paris. With tons of empty quarries, police and priests alike discreetly moved the bones to the renovated section of the tunnel over the period between 1787 and 1814.  As some notable people were buried in those “crowded” cemeteries, it is likely that their bones were transferred to the Catacombs. Some of the prominent Frenchmen whose bones might be placed in the Catacombs are Charles Perrault (famous for Little Red Riding Hood, Puss in Boots, and Cinderella), Jean de La Fontaine (known for Fables), Simon Vouet (painter), Salomon de Brosse (architect who designed Luxemburg Palace in Paris), and François Girardon (sculptor). The Catacombs became a popular attraction for royal families and the people of importance and in 1867, the area was opened to the general public.Due to their old age, the quarries not part of the official Catacombs have been deemed unsafe by Parisian officials. Nevertheless, the size and length of the tunnels make it difficult to keep secret societies, thieves, artists and the curious public from entering the dangerous network.In the 1980s, a movement was dedicated to the exploration of the tunnels. After the discovery of the secret cinema, Patrick Alk, a photographer close to the group responsible said the discovery “was a shame, but not the end of the world.” There are dozens of other meeting places just like the one the police discovered in the mysterious labyrinth. He concluded, saying, “you guys have no idea what’s down there.”Due to vandalism and the theft of several skulls, the catacombs were closed from October 2009 through December of the same year. With the reopening of the site comes additional security and bag checks upon exiting.","The vast, legendary catacombs hold secrets much stranger than stacked bones.  ","Jeannot's Floor,Sculptures de Décure,Arago Medallions","1 Place Denfert-Rochereau Paris, 75014 France",48.8343,2.3322,CPilgrimK8ecatSEANETTAricksteffstripsimonepuortoramonrodz2212mmarypippenrramonrodz2212mathewbrowneFred Cherrygardenthelibbydraegerssarahdinan75simonepuortobbeckaWe All Pod Down HereK8ecatrricksteffstripTeaAndCoffeeLoverMonsieur MictlanFaerieDanananpalmeroLauren Levesquebbeauty2goavgingercinnamonrachealanne83valely199ehorkleycchristinutza91oliverh72BBronwyn WestmoreBhob DnotoriousFIGKKidiuBlindcolourcceasterlingSEANETTAkeithphiloursmarsMMartinBadAsh13jjarednagelAkazemEEscape ZeppelinDDelireusAnnetta Blackaack sed,2009-02-13 00:00:00,"Sculptures de Décure,Arago Medallions,Jeannot's Floor,Montparnasse Cemetery","Ossario di San Martino,Leuk Charnel House,Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte,Melník Chapel of Bones",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/catacombes-de-paris

Scientists and art historians tap into the collection in order to verify the origins of questionable paintings up for auction, or work to identify the key compounds of ancient colors in order to better preserve cultural masterpieces for generations to come.Though growing all the time, today’s Forbes Pigment Collection comprises a technicolor array of 2,500 samples, arranged most pleasingly by color. Displayed in little jars of sorts, the pigments mimic artists’ color wheels in 3D, morphing from purple to red to yellow to blue and back to purple again along the cases’ shelves. Picking highlights from the collection is a nigh impossible task, as generations of evolving taste and fashion appear side-by-side within the collection. A few perennially fascinating favorites include the vial of bona fide “royal purple,” whose insanely expensive and vibrant color comes from a sea snail. The difficulty of obtaining the snails prohibited anyone outside the Byzantine court from donning this finery (first for fiscal reasons, then later due to social stratification). Similarly prized for its rarity is the “ultra marine” used in medieval paintings, whose brilliant blue hues were wrought from a precise extraction process of Afghan lapis lazuli.Then there’s the doom contingent of pigments, which hold their own unique appeal. This includes the likes of “mummy brown,” popular in European painting in the 18th and 19th centuries, that was literally made of “ground-up ancient Egyptians and their pets.” If actual dead things don’t spark an appreciation for the ephemerality of beauty, perhaps an “emerald green” favored by household painters for centuries, and once employed by van Gogh is more appealing; though cheap to produce and purchase, its colorless fumes could prove deadly to those using it. Similarly, the highly toxic “realgar,” whose jar is scrawled with POISON, gets its bright yellowish-green hue from arsenic sulfide reminiscent of the roiling landscape at Ethiopia’s uninhabitable Dallol Valley.If it hasn’t become apparent already, the thousands of shades on display at the Forbes Pigment collection are a library of more than just color — though for their beauty alone, that would be enough. Rather, each item on display, carefully curated and preserved by a team of the world’s premier conservators, holds its own fascinating story without which the history of the world’s art would not exist.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

Originally there were nine of the passageways dug into the hills, but as railroad travel in the area dwindled, three of the tunnels succumbed to age and vandalism and collapsed.  According to the most prevalent folktale, one of the remaining tunnels collapsed while a school bus full of waifs was driving through it killing the driver and the entire complement of kids. leaving their unquiet little spirits to linger around the tunnels. People have reported everything from tiny hand prints in the dust on their cars to being scratched and groped by unseen spirits.The story is likely apocryphal as the tunnel collapsed in 1988 and no news reports of deaths caused by the tunnel collapse can be found.  Other tunnels in the area are said to be haunted by the spririts of workers killed during construction, however.In reality, three of the nine tunnels did collapse, and today these collapses have cause a major detour for automobile traffic. The collapsed tunnel above Helen Hunt Falls has been blocked off with a black steel fence adorned with ominous “Keep Out” signs that look like they are just begging someone to fabricate an outlandish horror story about the site.

Despite his training as a member of the Catholic order, Bruno came to believe that the universe was infinite and that there were multiple important worlds, all of which were equally overseen by an aspect of God. Of course the ruling church of the time branded Bruno a heretic and held a trial that took seven years to complete.     Finally on February 17, 1600 Bruno, who never recanted on his beliefs, was led into the Campo de’ Fiori with a spike thrust through his tongue. At the request of Cardinal Bellarmine he was burned at the stake and his ashes were cast into the nearby river Tiber, creating a controversial proto-martyr for the scientific revolution. Witnesses wrote that before the fire was lit he refused to kiss a crucifix preferring to die a martyr in the hopes that the flames carry his soul into heaven. In 1889 the current monument to the philosopher was erected, with the robed figure of Bruno facing the Vatican. Church officials rankled at the clear offense, but could not get the statue removed.While the Vatican has issued apologies for its misguided persecution of early scientific searchers such as Galileo, to this day they have refused to remove Bruno’s label of heretic despite a small amount of public outcry. However the statue that stands tall among the oblivious tourists milling about the Campo de Fiori ensures that Bruno’s tragedy is not forgotten.  ",This ritzy Italian market is built around a statue of an unforgiven heretic who was burned for his belief in an endless universe. ,"Borromini's Perspective Gallery of Palazzo Spada,Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte,Passetto del Biscione","Campo de Fiori Rome, 00186 Italy",41.8956,12.4722,ThomLaBkatielou106merarirubalcava,2014-03-10 00:00:00,"Passetto del Biscione,Borromini's Perspective Gallery of Palazzo Spada,Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte,Torre Argentina (Roman Cat Sanctuary)","'Mullum Mullum the Owl',Josie Lyon Statue and Grave,Lyhdynkantajat (The Lantern Bearers),Scioto Lounge Deer Sculptures",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/campo-de-fiori
249,Wheeler Geologic Area,"natural history,natural wonders,geology,nature",59,1011,"High in the La Garita Wilderness sits a once-popular, but nearly forgotten, otherworldly landscape formed by one of the most massive volcanic explosions in the earth’s history. Around 25 million years ago, a volcano exploded in the southern Colorado Rockies. It ejected approximately 1,200 cubic miles of material into the atmosphere that covered most of Colorado. The eruption was so massive, that the exact range of the ash fall is still unknown. The Tuff, known as Fish Canyon Tuff, has an average depth of about 300 feet. It was formed during a single cooling event which indicates it came from a single explosion. The caldera that was created is known as the La Garita Caldera and is an oblong crater around 22 by 47 miles long. It’s centered on La Garita mountain. The edges of the caldera weren’t conclusively established by researchers until about 20 years ago.Eruptions continued in the region for about two million years. Ash and breccia, larger pieces of volcanic material, were layered across the landscape. The Wheeler Geologic Area, named after George M. Wheeler, United States Army Corp of Topographical Engineers. Wheeler conducted extensive studies in the area from 1873 to 1884. The Wheeler Geologic Area was established as a National Monument in 1908 by Theodore Roosevelt following a glowing detailed description by Frank Spencer, a Forest Service supervisor, and Elwood Bergy, a landowner in Wagon Wheel Gap in 1907. The newly established monument became the second most popular tourist attraction in Colorado after Pike’s Peak shortly after its creation. However, the popularity of the monument in its earlier years was due to a different attitude towards travel. During the early 1900s, people were willing to spend hours or days to get to remote locations, and often did so by horse. As transportation changed from horse and wagon to automobiles, the difficulty of reaching the monument caused its popularity to fade. The area was soon delisted as a National Monument in 1950.In 1969, a new road was constructed within 14 miles of the site. In 1993, the entire area was placed under the La Garita Wilderness area with a narrow corridor carved out of the wilderness to create a road. Today, the area can be reached by an eight-mile hike or by a very rough 14-mile, 4-wheel-drive trip. Walking or driving can take similar amounts of time.",This once-popular otherwordly landscape was formed by one of the largest volcanic eruptions in history.  ,"Bachelor Loop Interpretive Site,Creede Underground Mining Museum and Community Center,The Gravesite of Robert Ford","Creede, Colorado, 81130 United States 37.8839, -106.7837Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyBachelor Loop Interpretive Site7.85 milesCreede Underground Mining Museum and Community Center8.08 milesThe Gravesite of Robert Ford8.36 miles",37.8839,-106.7837,cyccommutesumac,2020-10-05 00:00:00,"Bachelor Loop Interpretive Site,Creede Underground Mining Museum and Community Center,The Gravesite of Robert Ford,La Ventana Arch","High Rock Canyon Wilderness,Al Wathba Fossil Dunes,Cedar Bluff Reservoir,Prästens Badkar (The Priests Bathtub)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wheeler-geologic-area

251,The Wreck of the King Philip,"shipwrecks,hidden,ruins",163,1013,"Visible only at very low tides, the Wreck of the King Philip on San Francisco’s Ocean Beach is the most complete remains of an American medium clipper ship in the world, and given how little is left of the vessel, that’s saying something.The King Philip was built in 1856 and wrecked in 1878. In her short life span she survived at least two mutinies, and was set on fire on both occasions. After she was shipwrecked and sold for scrap, it took three attempts to demolish her. Over a hundred years later, after having been buried in the sands of time, she still refuses to be forgotten.On January 25, 1878, the King Philip had just left dry dock with new sails and rigging. She was being towed by a tugboat to guide her through the treacherous waters of the Golden Gate, when a captain of a nearby ship suddenly died, and the towboat was called out to assist. The King Philip dropped anchor, but the anchor did not hold, and the ship ran aground in heavy surf. Luckily, all of the members of the crew survived as they were so close to shore, however, the ship was beyond repair and was sold for scrap.Valued in 1877 at $20,000, or nearly half a million dollars by today’s standards, the ship was still in good condition when she was wrecked, and was sold at auction the next day for $1050, or about $23,000 today. The new owners of the ship, in order to salvage the 40 tons of iron and thousands of dollars of brass and copper fixings, attempted to blow the shipwreck up with seven boxes of dynamite holding 200 pounds of blasting powder each. The first two attempts failed, much to the disappointment of the spectators who thronged to Ocean Beach to witness the explosion.The ruins of the King Philip are infrequently visible, and only at low tide. The wreck was partially visible in 1902, when another ship wrecked in the same spot. Both ships were buried in 1910 when the sand dunes were bulldozed to make way for the Great Highway. The first modern appearance of the King Philip was in 1982. She then disappeared beneath the tides and shifting sands and did not reappear until 2007, when construction on the Ocean Beach sewer outfall again buried the ship. Since 2010, she has made several re-appearances, and if you time your visit for low tide (usually early morning) you just might catch a glimpse of this fascinating piece of San Francisco history.",This partially buried wreck is one of the most complete of its kind but is only revealed when the sea allows. ,"Murphy Windmill,Golden Gate Park Diorama,Last Known Carville House","San Francisco, California, 94122 United States 37.7594, -122.5108Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyLast Known Carville House0.27 milesMurphy Windmill0.41 milesGolden Gate Park Diorama0.69 miles",37.7594,-122.5108,thirdthreshold,2013-05-30 00:00:00,"Last Known Carville House,Murphy Windmill,Golden Gate Park Diorama,Beach Chalet WPA Murals ","The Garden House,Roman Ruins of Salaborsa Library,Wash Woods Settlement,Trollskogen (The Troll Forest)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-wreck-of-the-king-philip-san-francisco-california

Wright was renovating his century-old home, his young daughters made a delightful discovery: itty, bitty, six-inch doors scattered throughout the space. When opened, the doors revealed tiny railings inside that led to other miniature doors. There were even windows springing up, where lights inside would magically turn on and off.By 2005, Wright had become a full-fledged Fairyologist, documenting the little doors that were now springing up all around town—obviously, they were fairies, what else could they be? His website has documentation of over two dozen doors from these “urban fairies.”At the Ann Arbor District Library, the creatures made a home out of a bookcase and several books on fairy tales. Then there is the Peaceable Kingdom, a gift shop where the fairies set up their own elaborate store, filled to the brim with fairy favorites: pennies, toys, acorns, and all other manners of bric-a-brac.

After selling a friend’s painting of a turnip almost by accident, Anthony realized that there could be money in art made from the items he had simply collected as a matter of course for his whole life. Using everything from animal bones to rusted metal to jars full of creepy-looking dead critters, Anthony filled his former taxidermy shop with homemade pieces of art and objects of curiosity.Soon the 500-square-foot cabin was completely full of his creations and the museum was born. His signature style, aside from the use of the dead animals he is so used to, is to trace impressionistic skeletons over vintage photographs, and adding illustration to what would otherwise be considered motel paintings.Anthony says that he is trying to recreate the small town folk museums that used to feature in every tiny town in America, although he describes his as closer to “P. T. Barnum on crack.” The Museum of Wonder is joined on Anthony’s land by the Possum Trot, a barbeque joint/junker’s auction.

254,Old Slave Mart,"us civil war,slavery,shops,museums",1321,1013,"Built in 1859, the Old Slave Mart was actually constructed due to a tightening of slavery laws that led to the creation of no-less-horrible private auctions. Although Congress banned participation in the international slave trade in 1808, it did not outlaw the domestic trade in enslaved people of African descent until 1865. During the height of the American slave trade, as many as 35-40 percent of enslaved people passed through Charleston while being forced into labor at plantations across the American South. Traditionally the auctioning of enslaved people took place in public displays along the city’s north side, but in 1856, the city put a stop to the public sale of enslaved people.This did not stop the practice, it simply prompted the creation of private auction houses like the Old Slave Mart. The auction front was built on Chalmers Street and soon became a bazaar of teeming private auction businesses. In addition to enslaved people, the mart also auctioned livestock and farmland. The cruel and inhumane industry came to an end when the Union army occupied Charleston, and over the years all of the auction houses except for the Old Slave Mart were dismantled.In the years following the city’s initial emancipation efforts, the historic building was used as a tenement, a museum, and a car dealership. Today the site hosts a museum devoted to remembering the history of slavery in Charleston. The museum is even staffed by some members who have traced their heritage to enslaved people who were auctioned off in the very building.While similar markets and locations around the country have been repurposed as historic buildings with little to no acknowledgment of their past, the Old Slave Mart faces its relationship to the horrific history of American slavery head on.",South Carolina's last remaining slavery auction house is now a museum devoted to its own tragic history. ,"Giant's Causeway Pillar ,Tavern at Rainbow Row,Fireproof Building and South Carolina Historical Society","6 Chalmers Street Charleston, South Carolina, 29401 United States",32.7778,-79.9284,whitney8251TaterchipsjanetfieldsCollector of ExperiencesbrettcolenfernandezbbrettcolennfernandezTTaterchipsjjanetfieldsCollector of ExperiencesBlindcolourMolly McBride JacobsonlleslipetersonMom0ja,2014-03-07 00:00:00,"Tavern at Rainbow Row,Fireproof Building and South Carolina Historical Society,Giant's Causeway Pillar ,Rainbow Row","The Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library,America's Black Holocaust Museum,Leonard A.

Like any good abandoned asylum, it’s damp, dilapidated, and deathly silent.The estate of Pool Park (spelled Parc in Welsh) began as a deer park for the nearby Ruthin Castle. Following its time as a hunting ground, the property was passed between a series of wealthy landowners. The elegant mock-Tudor style manor house that still stands today was constructed in 1862 for the second Lord Bagot.In 1937, the house was sold to the North Wales Counties Mental Hospital, which was in need of a second location to house overflow patients from the nearby Denbigh Insane Asylum (the super haunted one with all the cages and lobotomies). Pool Park held 87 patients at capacity, but in times of need had as many as 120. For a brief stint of time during World War II, the grounds also held a prisoner of war camp.Today, the solid wooden floors and intricate wood paneling have rotted due to water damage. The house has been looted for lead and copper, and its ceilings are dripping water and shedding plaster. You’ll be hard-pressed to find an intact window.

During the 19th century, Concord became a hot bed of forward-thinking transcendentalists who were eager to usher in a new age in American history. Many of the followers of the social movement would go on to pen some of the most indelible works of literature in the American canon. From Henry David Thoreau’s natural reflections in Walden, to the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, their progressive ideals would help shape the direction of national thought.Then, of course, they died.The list of names of famous authors who died while living in Concord is impressive. There are Thoreau and Emerson, but also Nathaniel Hawthorne, Louisa May Alcott and her family, and William Ellery Channing, all interred near one another.Author’s Ridge is a popular pilgrimage site for lovers of literature.

The Higgins Boat was designed and built in New Orleans, and thus the city became the chosen location for the museum. The museum got its current name in 2006 after an act of Congress two years prior officially designated the museum as “America’s National World War II Museum,” formalized an affiliation with the Smithsonian, and slightly widened its scope.Today the museum retains its focus on military history, skipping ahead two years into the war to focus exclusively on the United States’ involvement via immersive, high-production exhibitions with bombastic titles including Arsenal of Democracy and Campaigns of Courage (housed in buildings with names like US Freedom Pavilion and Hall of Democracy). Military history enthusiasts will enjoy the focus on strategy, troop movement, and weaponry.

As the legend goes, a group of convicts were being transferred from a nearby insane asylum when their bus crashed, releasing the crazed criminals. While most were found dead or recovered, two managed to escape. For a time. Not long after the crash, the body of one of the convicts was found hanging from the Colchester Overpass, and according to some accounts had a note attached signed, “The Bunny Man.” The search continued for the second convict and a number of half-eaten rabbits were said to have been found hanging in the trees in the area. Finally the killer was cornered, but was hit by a passing train before he could be apprehended.Of course there was never any insane asylum in the area, but the story has managed to stick. In the 1970s there were some reports of a crazed man in a white outfit — which was alternately described as a rabbit costume and/or a Ku Klux Clan robe — who would harass and threaten people for trespassing on his property. No one was ever convicted for the attacks, but this is likely the true source of the tales of the Bunny Man. No matter where it originated, the tale of the Bunny Man continues to this day, and now it is said that if one crosses through the tunnel at midnight on Halloween, the hatchet-bearing killer will appear and murder such bold intruders, hanging them from the bridge. ",This Virginia railway overpass is said to be haunted by a serial killer in a rabbit costume. ,"Fairfax Nike Missile Site,Fairfax Station Railroad Museum,St. Mary's Church","6498 Colchester Road Fairfax Station, Virginia, 22039 United States",38.7953,-77.3663,sweetspectrefranknbing63BrittanyZRiversendMartindanmeushddanmeushffranknbing63RiversendexploringwitheschddmekonnengobruenBBrittanyZrugby007MMartin,2015-01-14 00:00:00,"Fairfax Nike Missile Site,Fairfax Station Railroad Museum,St. Mary's Church,Mount Gilead","The 11 Bridges of Wayne,Falks Grav,Pont du Diable (Devil's Bridge),Gespensterwald (Ghost Forest)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunny-man-bridge-2

To his annoyance, however, he discovered someone was already living there; a horrible dragon, who shot lasers of fire from his blazing eyes. St. Beatus, however, would not be run out of his cave so easily, and held his cross up to the beast, invoking the Holy Trinity. Thrown into a hysteric fit, the dragon ran down the cliff and threw himself into Lake Thun below, causing the placid clear water to rise and boil. So the legend goes.Like the Alps once were, the St. Beatus Cave is largely unexplored, but a small portion is open to the public. The setting of the cave is reason to visit alone - the beautiful old fashioned Swiss-style building that serves as the cave entrance clings to a vertical rock face. A waterfall seems to leak from beneath the structure, and into Lake Thun below. Bridges and walkways cross the waterfall, and as one climbs to the top, each vista is more inspiring than the last.The cave tour includes many charmingly named stalactites and stalagmites, and a number of underground waterfalls and lakes. Back in the light of day, a visit to the small museum is rewarded with cave bear artifacts discovered within Beatus, and a history of the dangers and delights of caving.

What was discovered was a treasure trove of items and structural remnants that paint a vivid picture of everyday commercial life in Kraków over the past 700 years, and even beyond.The unique, fully-underground excavation uncovered not only the remnants of merchant stalls and various quotidian objects — such as weights, coins, clothing, and jewelry — but also preserved stretches of medieval thoroughfares, remnants of a settlement that was destroyed by raiding Tatars in 1241, centuries-old aqueducts, and a cemetery showcasing some of the peculiar burial practices of the 11th century.Rynek Underground, opened in 2010, is the museum that was built to showcase this treasure trove of Kraków history, and mixes the artifacts and restored archaeological sites with lasers, smoke machines, holograms, and 600 three-dimensional models of everyday objects manipulated via 37 touchscreens.

264,Evergreen Memorial Park & Crematory,catacombs and crypts,346,1007,"Established in 1877, Evergreen Memorial Park and Crematory is Los Angeles’ oldest cemetery. Tucked away in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East L.A., this 67-acre park is the final resting place for many of Los Angeles’ past mayors, prominent citizens, and pioneers.In addition, Los Angeles’ ethnic roots can be traced here: Evergreen is one of the city’s only cemeteries never to have banned African-Americans from being buried there. There’s also a huge area dedicated to Chinese-Americans, dating back to California’s gold rush when Chinese immigrants came to the region in large numbers. Armenians, Serbs, and other ethnic groups have their own areas as well, with inscriptions in their own scripts.A few other interesting, historical, and downright weird facts about the park:There’s a beautiful monument located in the center of the park honoring the soldiers of Japanese descent who fought for the 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Unit in WWII. The monument was dedicated in 1949, but in 2010 President Obama honored this unit by bestowing upon them the Congressional Medal of Honor.There are several graves that date back to the 1830s scattered throughout the park. When the cemetery was established in 1877, some families moved the bodies of their loved ones from their backyards and had them reburied here.Over 300,000 persons are buried here and of that number, over 400 are departed carnival workers or “carnies.” In 1922, the Pacific Coast Showman’s Association was established to assist carnival workers, including finding burial spots for them. Among the carnies buried in Evergreen are Emily Bailey, known as the 300-pound fat lady, and Hugo Zacchini, the first human cannonball.",Los Angeles's oldest cemetery allows visitors to trace the history of this proud city. ,"River Under the First Bridge,Linda Vista Hospital,Odd Fellows Cemetery ","204 North Evergreen Avenue  Los Angeles, California, 90033 United States",34.042,-118.2012,Matt BlitzMartinarmeniapediaKeri KilgoRachelAvoiding Regret,2013-10-20 00:00:00,"Linda Vista Hospital,Odd Fellows Cemetery ,River Under the First Bridge,Two Bit Circus Micro-Amusement Park","Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery,Café in the Crypt,St. Louis Cathedral,Crypt of Dr. William Edward Minahan",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/evergreen-memorial-park-crematory

In this case, the ancient lake bed dried up, leaving only the hole.The area around Fort Rock Basin has a legacy of volcanic activity, leaving caches of obsidian and cinder cones along with old lava flows and caves.The desolate landscape is so alien that astronauts were brought to the crater for training in the 1960s.The Hole in the Ground is near another larger and more eroded maar crater known as the Big Hole.",Massive crater in central Oregon. ,"Fort Rock,Big Hole,Cowboy Dinner Tree","Lake, Oregon United States 43.4122, -121.1971NearbyBig Hole6.04 milesFort Rock6.90 milesCowboy Dinner Tree25.05 miles",43.4122,-121.1971,Annetta Blackrenkesslerdwhitten9699slgwvmbisonslgwvdwhitten9699MMinisaurusMMartinrrenkesslermmbisonAnnetta Black,2010-01-17 00:00:00,"Big Hole,Fort Rock,Cowboy Dinner Tree,Lava Cast Forest","Painted Dunes ,Leiðarendi Lava Tube,Pingualuit Crater Lake,Meteor Crater",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hole-ground

Built by the British in 1771 to protect the wealthy colonial city of Philadelphia, Fort Mifflin was in American hands when the seeds of revolution took root.As General George Washington suffered a series of defeats in the Philadelphia Campaign in the fall of 1777, he recognized the importance of disrupting the supply route for the British army occupying Philadelphia. Washington ordered the garrison at the little fort to “hold to the last extremity” as they faced off against the mightiest navy of the 18th-century world.Ultimately surrounded on three sides and out of ammunition and black powder, the garrison evacuated to Fort Mercer. A detail of 40 young soldiers remained behind to spike the last 10 functioning cannons and set fire to any valuable remains. They left the distinctive 13-stripe flag flying as they, too, finally rowed away from the burning fort. Although defeated, Fort Mifflin never surrendered. General Washington used the time to establish winter quarters at Valley Forge emerging the following spring better trained and organized, and with the official support of France.The fort was rebuilt beginning in the late 18th century and as part of the First and Second Systems of Seacoast Fortifications answered every call to service over three centuries. As such, one visit to Fort Mifflin lets you stand on a Revolutionary War battlefield, in a Civil War prison, and on the site of a “home front” defense in World War II.Perhaps because of the many hardships suffered there, the Fort is also on just about every list of the most haunted locations in the country.

269,La Scarzuola,"outsider architecture,churches,sacred spaces,architecture",74,1005,"Although La Scarzuola began as a Franciscan monastery, today’s architectural wonderland has little to do with traditional religion, reflecting instead the esoteric beliefs of a visionary Milanese architect.That architect, Tomaso Buzzi, acquired the property in 1956 with the grand plan of juxtaposing the “sacred city” of the monastery with his own “ideal city” that would be a hauntingly dreamlike allegory for the mysteries and perplexing paths of the ideal life. His style blends reality with surrealist architecture, incorporating structures and details from Classical to Medieval and even Renaissance architecture, all tied together by overarching Neomannerist elements such as stairways leading in multiple directions, general unbalance and disproportion, and monstrous and fantastical design elements.His work spans the body of surrealism from Dali and Miro to M.C. Escher, echoing their dark works in his immense compound. The core of the Città Ideale is formed by seven theaters, representing Buzzi’s notion that the ideal life (and the mysterious initiations associated with it) is inherently and symbolically theatrical. The theaters are surrounded by grounds that include multiple grottos and reflecting pools and are surmounted by an “Acropolis” that consists of a riot of buildings all piled together (including many reproductions — the Arc de Triomphe, the Temple of Vesta, the Parthenon, etc.), which are mostly empty inside, save for stairways and inner bridges.Each work is carefully constructed to represent the inner thoughts of the artist, as well as a blend of the philosophical tenets that guided his life. Although the styles and buildings change by the meter in the compound, his overall surrealistic approach is defined especially through the random scattering of quotes and strange symbols placed throughout La Scarzuola.Considered the artist’s “autobiography in stone,” La Scarzuola is deeply personal and those familiar with the artist will find him in every brick laid in the compound. After his death in 1981, his nephew Marco Solari continued to work on La Scarzuola, eventually completing the vision his uncle had for his ideal city.",This 16th-century monastery has been turned into a surrealist architecture compound. ,"Orvieto Underground,Pozzo di San Patrizio,Pozzo della Cava","Località Montegiove Montegabbione (TR), 05010 Italy",42.8984,12.1534,serflacLa FattinaekneenRHyzeratimian,2016-03-01 00:00:00,"Pozzo di San Patrizio,Pozzo della Cava,Orvieto Underground,Bosco del Sasseto","Saint Michael and All Angels Church,St. Nicholas Orthodox Church,New England Peace Pagoda,Cadet Chapel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-scarzuola

Guides describe and demonstrate how to make axe heads and how to utilize mammoth tusks in home-building. They also explain how our ancestors ate one another.Cannibal Cottage is more than just a gruesome horror tour. When the exhibit first opened, it was controversial, particularly for its collection of slaughtered human bones. These remains are nearly thirteen thousand years old and prove that the first humans were cannibals. The museum attempts to contextualize these findings by detailing the history of cannibalism, how and why it might have been necessary, and the evolution of Homo sapiens.Those visitors who are uninterested in graphic cannibalism can paint their own cave wall or examine the giant cave-bear skeleton. The area where the skeletons have been found, Cheddar Gorge, was named the second greatest natural wonder in Britain, and it boasts adventure hiking and cave exploration, nature and conservation walks, and gorge walks with British goats. For a less strenuous route to spectacular views, tourists can board one of the gorge’s open-top buses to the prehistoric riverbeds.Explorers can also hike to Nature’s Cathedral, a quarter mile cave formed by an Ice Age river, and glimpse breathtaking geological wonders. The stalactites and stalagmites in these caverns have been building for hundreds of thousands of years. It was in this area, Gough’s cave, that the Cheddar man, Britain’s oldest complete skeleton, was discovered. The Mesolithic hunter-gatherer’s body was buried there nine thousand years ago.

At Bube’s Brewery and Catacombs in Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, that necessity arises at least once a month. These lavish occasions are hosted in the brewery’s underground Catacombs Restaurant, a beer-aging cellar that doubles as a fine-dining establishment and, occasionally, a pirate’s ship, with actors in period costumes rubbing elbows with guests dining on multiple courses and, of course, the restaurant’s own microbrews.It’s an occasion as colorful as the history of this inn and pub, which has been quenching visitors’ thirsts since 1876. The brewery was established by one Alois Bube, a German immigrant who capitalized on the 19th-century popularity of lagers in the United States to launch his own enterprise. He was in luck to have ended up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania: At the time, it was known as the “Munich of the New World” due to its thriving German beer scene. Over the years, Bube built his establishment into a beer behemoth, with a labyrinthine premises including a bar, the “catacombs,” and an inn that featured the town’s first flushing toilet. The brewery, like other such establishments, was shut down during Prohibition, but by that time the family had become so wealthy that Bube’s descendants were able to keep the building, which remained untouched until 1968, when they remodeled and reopened.Today, Bube’s Brewery looks like a cross between a Renaissance fair (which it becomes during monthly medieval feasts) and a Victorian haunted house (which it becomes during regular ghost tours). The inn has retained the spirit of its original construction—including its shared bathrooms—with the exception of a top-floor penthouse and lavish themed decorations.The current brewery, meanwhile, is housed in the original ice house. The establishment’s star attraction remains the Catacombs Restaurant. Descend 43 feet underground to the stone-lined basement, complete with enormous wooden barrels, and you will surely feel you have traveled back in time, especially when you encounter a tableful of fellow diners clad in medieval costumes.",In the bowels of a 19th-century brewery lurks a fine-dining restaurant offering an array of themed feasts. ,"The White Cliffs of Conoy,Big Chiques Bridge #4,National Watch and Clock Museum ","102 North Market Street Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, 17552 United States",40.1118,-76.503,Reina Gattusotravelsyte,2020-02-04 00:00:00,"Big Chiques Bridge #4,National Watch and Clock Museum ,The White Cliffs of Conoy,Wheatland","Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus,'Catacombs' of Petrovaradin Fortress,Ripon Cathedral Crypt,Catacombs of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bubes-brewery-and-catacombs

The men who built it called it The Poison Road; its craggy terrain is known as desert slickrock; it is surrounded by the Box-Death Hollow wilderness area; and it winds around a town called Salt Gulch. The road’s name is most evocative of all: Hell’s Backbone.There are two roads between the towns of Boulder and Escalante, Utah. One, a lovely route over Scenic Byway 12, is paved. The other, Hell’s Backbone, is most certainly not. Both roads were built in the early 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (the CCC), the construction and public works arm of the Works Projects Administration (the WPA). Before 1933 there were no automobile routes to Boulder or between the two towns, there were only wagon routes and mule trails. When the CCC was formed under the WPA, the two towns asked for funding to bring them into the 20th century. They got it, starting with a gravel road along the ridge called Hells’ Backbone. Given the sheer drop along some stretches, it was the CCC crews who dubbed it the Poison Road – one false step, and down you go.It only took the CCC a couple of years to complete Hell’s Backbone Road, which is still gravel today. It took a few more years to complete the paved road, which was finished by 1940. It is still the smooth, all-weather route between Boulder and Escalante.

He died in 1938, but the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad vice president specifically built his namesake hotel to attract moneyed future-visitors en route to a little tourist trap in the Black Hills: Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock and Grant were stationed in Rapid City to shoot the now-legendary scene atop the gargantuan presidential carvings, but had their permit revoked when U.S. Parks officials caught wind of the scene’s violent nature. After shooting the cafeteria scene on location, the actual monument skirmish took place in a California studio where Hollywood magic made the final cut look like the real thing.   Besides his interest in attracting monied guests, Johnson admired the culture of the local Lakota Sioux tribes. He decorated his hotel lobby with Native American art, including woven rugs, hand-painted ceiling beams, and handmade floor tiles representing the “four sacred corners of the Earth.” Today, hotel visitors can see it as it was from the start. Those not familiar with the Native American “whirling logs” symbol—representing the sun, the four directions, and the four seasons—might easily mistake the floor tiles for Nazi swastikas.  Like any historic hotel, the Alex Johnson has its fair share of ghost stories. The “Lady in White,”  who haunts the eighth floor, was supposedly a bride who leapt to her death from room 812. Eighth floor guests have purportedly awoken to find their windows opened and their dresser drawers turned upside down. There have been other reports of a mischievous little girl ghost (possibly that of Johnson’s daughter, who died of polio at the hotel) and of Johnson himself roaming the hallways. The hotel capitalizes on its haunted reputation: Guests can book a Ghost Adventure Package for an extra charge, which includes an overnight stay in a reportedly haunted room with a K2 meter, aka a “ghost detector.”","One of America’s oldest and spookiest hotels, thanks to the residency of ghosts, dead presidents, and Alfred Hitchcock. ","The Rapid City Presidents,Firehouse Brewing Co.,Art Alley","523 6th St Rapid City, South Dakota United States",44.0804,-103.2275,Vicki ArkoffwisemandrebecaschandelFluttergirlheathersfourrachelvadnais27hheathersfourrrachelvadnais27wisemandrebecaschandelCollector of ExperiencesMolly McBride JacobsonFFluttergirl,2017-04-06 00:00:00,"Firehouse Brewing Co.,The Rapid City Presidents,Art Alley,Depression Era Dinosaur Park","The Mizpah Hotel,Gran Hotel Bolivar,Hotel Majestic,The Golden North Hotel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hotel-alex-johnson
277,Mount Wood Castle and Cemetery,"graffiti,castles,cemeteries,ruins",202,1003,"The city of Wheeling, West Virginia is steeped in a mythology of excess in decline. Once home to more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the country, populated with gangsters and tycoons, skimming off shipping along the Ohio when industry was rich, recent decades have dealt the city a hand equal to that of its Rust Belt brethren. This means that teasing out fact from fiction can, at times, be a tricky proposition. Such is the case with the Mount Hood Overlook, often referred to by locals as “the Castle.” Popular legend says that an unknown soul abandoned the magnificent dream structure when his lady love unexpectedly perished. After some digging, however, local historians established that at least some of these aspects were true. In 1925, this property actually belonged to a local doctor who set out to build this dream home as a gift to his wife. Naturally, it would have a rounded, turret-like architectural feature with windows looking out on the best view of the city; the remnants of this, including its spiral staircase, and a second story form the entirety of the Mount Wood Overlook we know today. Unfortunately, the enterprising man in question was hauled off on federal drug trafficking charges before the structure was completed, and the property was “donated” (read: returned) to the City of Wheeling, which has retained control ever since. With languishing funds in all its coffers, the space has declined over the years and is nearly unrecognizable from the top. Only those curious enough to walk down its staircase and look up from the brush will see the potential of what it could have been.Among those who recognize its potential are those on the Wheeling Arts Commission, which has established a mission to reclaim the Castle from vandals. Through a project of “Guerrilla Gardening,” started in the summer of 2015, volunteers applied a natural slurry to grow moss in artistic patterns on top of the existing spray paint, which they see as an eyesore encouraging further blight upon the city.Across the road from the Castle is the Mount Wood Cemetery, which holds many old graves and mausoleums from many of Wheeling’s first residents. With grave markers dating back to the 1700s, many are so old and weatherbeaten that the inscriptions of their names and dates are illegible. Making use of the steep hillsides are dozens of sepulchers built directly into the earth. As with many of the mausoleums which contain remains of the early city’s most important families, the doors and windows have long since gone missing, only to be cemented closed by modern masons or padlocked shut to prevent further damage. Despite this, these limestone, brick, and marble structures and their cast iron trimmings retain a sort of sad beauty.Despite its picturesque location, a potent mixture of time, neglect, and vandalism have resulted in many of toppled obelisks and tombstones snapped off at the ground. Some gravestones have been paved over with asphalt to create the walking path through the cemetery. Nonetheless, the grounds provide a haunting-yet-fascinating glimpse into the former grandeur of Wheeling’s citizens in the face of America’s blue-collar economic downturn, all while standing in the very same spot that inspired the city’s founders in 1769 to attempt to “tame” the landscape in the first place.",This abandoned dream castle and its cemetery look out over the city that once inspired their creation. ,"Unofficial Lego Toy and Plastic Brick Museum ,Sweeney Punch Bowl ,New Vrindaban Palace of Gold","53 Mount Wood Rd.

Luckily, local officials took no issue with King Eddy’s sudden interest in music, and the business not only survived, but prospered. Now an official saloon once more, its basement still remains part of the tunnel system, littered with crumbling brick lines and graffiti murals.Aside from the service tunnels, there are also abandoned subway and equestrian tunnels from the days before personal vehicles began clogging up LA’s city streets. There are stories of these tunnels being used by police to transport prisoners, bank security to move large sums of cash safely, and both coroners and mobsters to store bodies. Now they are mostly closed off, but some are still accessible and are used as film locations, easy shortcuts by city employees between buildings, and a place for runners to train on the rare occasion of bad weather.To explore the former highway of the LA underground, you must slip behind the Hall of Records on Temple Street and locate an easy-to-miss elevator.

279,Le Chabanais,purveyors of curiosities,120,1002,"Art Deco grand staircases, balustrades covered in gold ropes interlaced with organic motifs – welcome to Le Chabanais, a “House of All Nations.”Opened by Madame Kelly just a few steps from the Louvre in 1878, Le Chabanais deserved its reputation for extravagance, both in the decor and the high-society personalities that spent their money and exercised their libidos in the arms of thirty superb “courtesans in residence.”With a cost of about 1.7 million francs invested (approximately $12.5 million US) and shares sold at an exorbitant price to wealthy private investors, Le Chabanais became the most profitable bordello of the European continent. A legend of the Maison Close golden era, it was a popular stop for rich European tourists, as obligatory as a prayer in Notre Dame Cathedral or visit to the Eiffel Tower.Like any good erotic fantasy playground, every room had a theme. The “Louis XVI” provided sex in decadent monarchic nostalgia, and the Moorish room was a favorite of poet Guy de Maupassant, who made his own replica of the room in his home. A frequent guest of Le Chabanais, King Edward VII or “Dirty Bertie” had a sphinx copper bathtub manufactured for his favored suite to allow for champagne skinny dips, while Toulouse-Lautrec, another famed brothel fancier of his era, donated to the establishment sixteen erotic oil paintings depicting centaurs in the throes of passion.This zealous sense of decoration, in all of its excess and exotic splendor, was officially celebrated when the “Japanese Room” won the prize for “Best Design” at the prestigious 1900 Paris World’s Fair, becoming a symbol of Parisian lifestyle, opulence and modernity.After decades of sleepless nights and erotic festivities, Le Chabanais closed, turning its red lantern off on April 13th, 1946. Houses of pleasure had been deemed illegal in the aftermath of WWII, plagued with rumors of collaboration and early feminism. All the furniture, from radiators to ashtrays, was sold at auction in 1951, scattering the fabulous interiors into private collections.Nowadays, 12 Rue Chabanais is a very tame office building; the only remnants remaining of its sulfurous past are the double elevators that once allowed randy customers to visit the different floors without risking an awkward run-in with other visitors.","A grotto-like lodge decorated with gilded mosaics, rocks and a noisy waterfall was the setting for the most sumptuous pleasure house of 1900s Europe. ","Au Bonheur du Jour,The Heart of Voltaire,Labrouste Reading Room","12 rue Chabanais Paris, 75002 France",48.8676,2.337,Laetitia BarbierMartinPrestonW,2013-01-17 00:00:00,"Au Bonheur du Jour,Labrouste Reading Room,The Heart of Voltaire,Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France)","Bolivia's Witch Market,Diggerland USA,Wicker Park Secret Agent Supply Co.,Bronner's Christmas Wonderland",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-chabanais-2

In 1851, the ship started its second life as a bar.A gangplank led to the entrance cut from the side of the ship, with a sign reading “Gud, bad and indif’rent spirits solds here! At 25 cents each.”Between 1849-1852, a huge number of ships were wrecked or abandoned in the San Francisco Bay as ship after ship arrived following the announcement of the discovery of gold in the Sacramento foothills. In 1850, over 500 ships were recorded as being at anchor in the formerly sleepy bay, some undoubtedly slowly rotting in place after their crews had headed to the gold fields.Like the nearby Niantic and other Gold Rush shipwrecks and abandoned vessels, the Arkansas quickly became part of the shoreside infrastructure.By 1855 the ship was landlocked by infilling at the bay (at least partially with rubble and ballast stones of other ships), and by 1859 all traces of the above-ground portion of the ship were removed. With the exception of the bad old days of prohibition, it’s been in the business of serving drinks for a century and a half.

Built around the mid-1700s, the church was nearly destroyed by the British during the Revolutionary War not many years after it was completed. The remains of the church would lay abandoned for decades after its first attempted destruction but the stone foundations that remained were finally rebuilt in 1826.Unfortunately this second life for the church was to be about as brief as the first. When General Sherman led his troops through South Carolina during the Civil War, they too felt like it would be a good time to put the Old Sheldon Church to the torch, once again burning the building down to its stone foundations. After this second defeat, the church was allowed to simply remain a ruin for the rest of its days.This may have been for the best since, today, the ruins are a beautiful feature set amongst tall, leaning oaks and smatterings of old graves from the brief periods the church was in service. Now the crumbling remains are often used for wedding photos and other moody photography.

283,Karl Junker House,outsider architecture,80,1002,"Karl Junker had both an advantage and disadvantage when it came to building his great vision. While he was a trained architect, by his thirties, he was also deeply schizophrenic. Never hospitalized, he created his life’s work—the architecture, furniture, design, and murals for his house—from a palette of the world inside his head.Living on the large sum of money left to him by his grandfather, Junker spent his life elaborating again and again on his singular masterpiece. Human faces peer out from the intricate ceiling murals, and the curved staircase is encased in a wooden structure like a cage. The house, which had no visitors or occupants except for Junker, was clearly designed by Junker for a family and guests. There is a nursery, a guest room, a salon, and a dining room, all formally decorated with hand-carved and gilded furniture. Everything points to a life that Junker yearned for, but knew he would never have. Despite the overall style of the house being unique to Junker’s mind, it does show some aspects of popular styles contemporary of the time, including Arts and Crafts, Neo-Gothic, Tudor Revival, Expressionism, Tramp Art, as well as older German vernacular.Near the end of his life, visitors began to arrive at the strange house, asking for tours. Junker obliged and, while showing them around, explained that he expected his architecture would one day prove to be revolutionary, like Wagner’s music. “Perhaps only after a hundred years, I will be valued correctly.”",An intricate and amazing house built by architect Karl Junker. ,"Externsteine,Hermannsdenkmal,Hexenbürgermeisterhaus","Hamelner Strasse 36 Lemgo, 32657 Germany",52.0261,8.9174,mbisonzePHenrynaturedudeahvenascmsspam 12ddc98dgingercinnamoncmzePnaturedudeahvenasAllisonEngHHenrywythe,2010-05-14 00:00:00,"Hexenbürgermeisterhaus,Hermannsdenkmal,Externsteine,Bielefeld Viaduct","Mosaic House of Dunedin,Enchanted Hart Haus ,Castillo Monumento Colomares,The Chapel of Jimmy Ray",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/karl-junker-house

286,Le Chat Noir Collection,"clubs,cats,animals,art,museums",295,1000,"In 19th-century Paris, the coolest cats in the city gathered in what would become its first modern cabaret. Sipping boozy beverages, they settled in for a night of raucous entertainment at Le Chat Noir, a name inspired by the owner’s love of the literature of Edgar Allan Poe and Baudelaire which often featured sinister and symbolic black cats. Though the legendary nightclub has long since shuttered, it lives on in popular culture thanks to its beloved mascot.Le Chat Noir only lasted from 1881 to 1897, but artwork and posters showing its signature cartoon black cat (also named Le Chat Noir) gained international esteem and became highly collectible. Even now, more than a century after the joint closed, it’s virtually impossible to pop into a Paris souvenir shop without seeing coffee cups, fridge magnets, posters, and postcards of the famous feline.The cabaret’s legacy is preserved in a more esteemed locale, too. The Musee de Montmartre houses a wonderful collection of Le Chat Noir artwork. Seeing original prints and handbills from the 1800s, all graced by the iconic black cat, is a sight to behold. There are also several related works in the museum’s collection.The famous poster was created by Theophile Steinlen, one of the leading poster artists of his day. Steinlen was a feline fancier who frequently featured cats in his poster designs. A fan of The elaborate halo behind the cat’s head in the Chat Noir poster is a nod to another poster designer of the day, Alphonse Mucha. Mucha often drew elaborate halo-like elements adorning the human figures in his work, and here Steinlen took the opportunity to make a tongue-in-cheek reference to his fellow designer.The museum is housed in the oldest home in all of Montmartre, the Bel Air House, which was built in the 16th century. Though the museum preserves a variety of significant art, it places a large emphasis on the history of the Montmartre area. The museum was once a home, so keep in mind there are several floors and staircases to explore.","Original cabaret handbills, posters, and feline artwork are a purrfect highlight of the Museum of Montmartre. ","Cimetière du Calvaire,I Love You Wall,Le Passe-Muraille",14 Rue Cortot Paris France,48.8877,2.3405,satxwdavisBev09Monsieur MictlanTalbot von Sregorcmkglittlemole,2018-02-13 00:00:00,"Cimetière du Calvaire,Le Passe-Muraille,I Love You Wall,Montmartre Funicular","Frieze of Lions,Ward Museum of Wildfowl Art,Blanco Renaissance Museum ,'Tire Lion'",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-chat-noir-collection

But at the Seven Keys Lodge (formerly known as the Baldpate Inn) in Estes Park, Colorado, all three of these places are represented—in the form of keys.The small bed and breakfast is home to the world’s largest collection of keys. With a total of more than 20,000 keys, there are three keys for every resident of Estes Park. Organized categorically by state, the collection is hung on the hotel’s ceiling and walls and has been receiving donations since the end of World War II.Featured in the key room are keys to a variety of European hotspots, including Westminster Abbey, Mozart’s wine cellar, Frankenstein’s Castle, and Adolf Hitler’s bunker. There is an extensive U.S. collection as well, with keys from the Pentagon and the White House bathroom, and the international collection includes a key to a Peruvian monastery and a key made in Egypt.If you look closer, keys from even more precarious circumstances can be found. There are keys to robbed banks, the dressing rooms of Hollywood actors, and yes, a piano key. Most of the keys in the collection have been donated by guests who stayed at the inn, spanning a wide variety of states and countries. If you visit, you can make a donation too!The Baldpate Inn was established in 1917 by brothers Charles and Gordon Mace. The hotel’s name and the idea for a key collection came from Seven Keys to Baldpate, a mystery novel written in 1913 about a man who visits the then-fictional Baldpate Inn to find some peace and seclusion. Unbeknownst to this man, six other characters also have a key, and they promptly open to door to the inn and distract him.Due to the similarity of the Estes Park lodge to the inn described in the story, the owners decided to name the hotel after the fictional inn in the novel. Subsequently, the key room was created to honor the importance of keys in the book, a literary tribute that has been transformed into a world record. Earl Derr Biggers, the author of Seven Keys to Baldpate, eventually accepted the Colorado establishment as the “true” Baldpate Inn.In December 2020, the Baldpate Inn came under new ownership. Mark and Meredith Powell have taken over the Estes Park landmark, and are working to restore the 100-year-old inn. The key collection remains, though the name of the hotel has changed to the Seven Keys Lodge.","The world's largest key collection features keys to the White House, Frankenstein's castle, and Hitler's bunker. ","The Stanley Hotel,Holzwarth Trout Lodge,Birthplace of the American Board of Orthodontics","4900 CO-7 Estes Park, Colorado, 80517 United States",40.3085,-105.5341,lewblankerjeffery,2017-08-31 00:00:00,"The Stanley Hotel,Birthplace of the American Board of Orthodontics,Holzwarth Trout Lodge,B-17 Bomber Crash Site","Mount Washington Hotel,Book and Bed Hostel,Dotonbori Hotel Front Pillars,Ducal Palace of Lerma",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baldpate-inn-key-collection
288,Buzz-A-Rama,"toys,cars",127,1000,"Nestled in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn is an unlikely mom-and-pop establishment that seems like it has been transported there from another time. The store is Buzz-A-Rama, a model slot car racing shop, and it’s been entertaining fans of the hobby since 1965.Back then, “Buzz” Perri was a 30-year-old entrepreneur and slot car enthusiast with dreams of owning his own racing shop. The store derives its name from his nickname, earned from his years as a high school track star when the audience “buzzed” over his performance on the field. In the late 1960s Buzz-A-Rama joined more than 40 other slot car establishments that ran throughout New York City’s many boroughs. There were 14 slot car shops in Brooklyn alone; all during the (mostly American) slot car craze of the mid 60’s through the early 70’s.Time and new trends in entertainment took its toll on the slot car trade. The industry began to slow with competition first from arcade games and later from home video games and a host of other modern diversions. Slot cars, much like model trains, slowly began to lose their mass appeal and became more of a specialist pursuit with many slot hobbyists focusing on competitive racing. Now Buzz-A-Rama is the last slot car store standing in all of New York City. It’s apparently been that way for quite some time.“I can’t even remember the last one that was in Brooklyn besides me - I know I must have put him out of business,” Buzz laughed. The store may have gone the way of the those others if it wasn’t for the Perris owning the building. Buzz and his wife Dolores live in Manhattan but commute down to the shop to run the show on weekends, still catering to the small but loyal clientele. For them, it’s a labor of love. “I’m not in it for the money” he says.The small plastic frame cars that whiz around the shops tracks are deceptively speedy. The 1/24 and 1/32 scale cars use 12 volt DC motors to race along the tracks with speeds ranging from 20 to over 100 mph. Yes, a tiny little car you can hold in the palm of your hand can go over 100 mph! A fast car can average about 300 laps in around 40 minutes. All the finesse is in the movements of the hand-held controller whose owner needs to watch the speed on curves to avoid a wipe out.This national hobby has a die-hard community that spends countless hours tweaking their cars to make them go faster. Some people buy kits, others build the whole model up from scratch, soldering gun in hand. A newbie who wants to buy into the hobby can buy a ready-to-race car for as little as $40 but it is not unheard of to spend up to $500 for a high end model.The shop has five different tracks that range in difficulty but there is a track suitable for just about any age group that wants to give it a try. Most of the tracks use the hand controller while others have mock pedals and steering wheels for a more authentic racing feel. In addition to the large scale 1/32 tracks there’s also an HO scale (1:87 to 1:64 scale) track that fans of the smaller, classic, home racing kits can enjoy. Anyone who remembers the best-selling Tyco race tracks of the late 1970s will be quick to recognize these smaller cars.Buzz-A-Rama is closed through the summer, June 15 - Sept 15, but open for business mid-Sept to mid June on weekends. Tracks can be reserved in advance for groups and parties but anyone can drop in and get on a track to race without needing to make a reservation.",The last slot car racing arcade in Brooklyn is keeping the dream of speedy little autos alive. ,"Ocean Parkway Malls Marine Life Plaques,Charles Feltman's Tomb,Torah Animal World","69 Church Ave Brooklyn, New York, 11218 United States",40.6425,-73.9808,Anna Minsteradamtager,2015-10-16 00:00:00,"Charles Feltman's Tomb,Ocean Parkway Malls Marine Life Plaques,Torah Animal World,The Tomb of Jane Griffith","Micheldever Station Red Wheel,AA Sentry Box #289,Starlight Drive-In Theatre,AVUS-Tribüne (Automobile Traffic and Practice Road)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buzzarama

A stroll through the garden takes visitors to Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral—complete with stained glass windows—to awe-inspiring castles constructed of pebbles and shells. Porcelain people populate various rooms and nooks throughout the structures, while small porcelain animals dot the landscape. The builder of this whimsical garden was DeWitt “Old Dog” Boyd, one of the members of the Calhoun Seventh Day Adventist Church. A hobbyist at heart, Boyd began creating tiny, whimsical villages for his eight children as a family game. Each time his family moved, Boyd would reconstruct a tiny village for his children, who each had an alter-ego porcelain figure to play with. Then in 2007, Boyd began the rock garden in Calhoun, saying “it was to keep me out of trouble, I’m kind of a scoundrel.”Today, the rock garden is a family endeavor and has been crafted by Boyd, his children, and their children. The free garden is located behind the Calhoun Seventh Day Adventist Church, and there are religious themes to some of the constructions. One of the towns represents Bethlehem; the Ten Commandments tablets are embedded, broken, in one of the walkways; and some other places have scriptures inscribed in walkways or walls. ",Incredible miniature towns and buildings created and decorated with thousands of tiny rocks. ,"The Berry College Campus,The Labyrinth of Rome,Grave of Brownie the Depot Dog","1411 Rome Rd SW Calhoun, Georgia United States",34.4629,-84.9827,tinabhicksonlefthandpath64Jennnwolfnotesthegenxjourneyc1mcfreysstroyan07Jennnllefthandpath64wolfnotescc1mcfreythegenxjourney,2018-09-10 00:00:00,"The Berry College Campus,The Labyrinth of Rome,Grave of Brownie the Depot Dog,Old Car City","Stone Garden,World Peace Flame Pathway,Three Sisters Sanctuary,Rectory Nurseries",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rock-garden-calhoun

In 2002, the airplane found a second life as the premier aviation restaurant in the United States.The owners of the Airplane Restaurant created a unique dining destination to draw in aviation buffs and share the history of the KC-97 tanker. The ex-Texas Air National Guard KC-97 mid-air refueling tanker was mated to the restaurant building with the port wing and the engine sticking through the wall and slicing through the “terminal” part of the restaurant. The wing serves as a place to mount lights and as a shelf for model airplanes and other aviation-related memorabilia.The giant gas tank was removed and the interior of the plane was flipped into a long, narrow dining room.  The tables are all covered with old aviation maps and charts and then laminated over.  The “crew” of the restaurant thanks you for flying with them and then offers a menu that is miles better than your typical airline fare. The cockpit and the tail of the aircraft have been left mostly intact and patrons can go sit in the pilot’s chair and imagine what it would be like to fly this behemoth of a piston driven airplane.  The tail has a mannequin dressed in 1950’s aircrew uniform demonstrating how it would look to be lowering the refueling boom to fuel up another aircraft while in flight.  It’s closed off with plexiglass but lit so everyone can see how it works.",This Boeing KC-97 tanker is now a restaurant for aviation lovers.  ,"Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum,Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun,Novis Mortem Collective","1665 Newport Rd Colorado Springs, Colorado United States",38.8067,-104.7263,toolmaker321alivetocurebq,2018-08-30 00:00:00,"Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum,Novis Mortem Collective,Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun,Starr Kempf's Kinetic Sculptures","Beautiful Betsy Crash Site,Ekranoplan Lun,Aviation Warehouse,Tehran Aerospace Exhibition Center",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colorado-airplane-restaurant

He decided to open his collection to the public, and it only proliferated from there.Tucked into an airy San Francisco loft, the Archive invites design lovers to come celebrate the art of handwriting throughout history. It’s a collection of over 30,000 artifacts of typography, calligraphy, and graphic design, spanning from ancient times to modern-day.The Archive is equal parts museum, art gallery, and reference library. There are postcards, books, posters, newspapers, drawings, and of course, letters, as well as practically any other written format imaginable. The collection as a whole interrogates design in writing, both man- and machine-made.

The original Myers house used in the film is actually located in California, but when Caperton built his house, he could not locate the blueprints of the original, which was built in 1888. Nonetheless, he went to the film and faithfully recreated the interior as best he could, only updating it to be more livable, but keeping the corridors as tight and claustrophobic as in the film. The decorations have also been updated since Caperton and his wife actually live in the house, but an entire bookshelf alcove has been devoted to Caperton’s awesome collection of Halloween memorabilia, even including the masks from the much maligned, Michael-Myers-free third installment, Halloween III: Season of the Witch.Visitors are encouraged to come by around in October when the home is appropriately kitted out for the season.

295,Church of St. Ursula,"ossuaries,relics,relics and reliquaries,saints,catacombs and crypts,sacred spaces",285,999,"The short version of the story goes a little something like this: Saint Ursula was a Roman-British Princess who, in the 300s, decided she would go on a pan-European pilgrimage. She packed a boat with her 11,000 virginal best friends—which immediately calls to question what kind of boat in the 300s could have fit 11,000 people on it—and the giggling virgins set out for Rome.In a miraculous turn of events, a freak storm blew the boat to Rome in a single day, and Ursula convinced the Pope and a few other religious figures to join them on their pilgrimage. Everything was going great until the ladies stopped in Cologne, where they were captured by the Huns—a sort of collective boogeyman plaguing Europe at the time. All 11,000 virgins were promptly beheaded and Ursula was shot dead.In 1155 a mass grave was found in Cologne—they had already found some remains claimed to be the virgins, but this was the jackpot - and it was assumed by the Church that this must be the gravesite of Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. The church, which was already dedicated to St. Ursula, was expanded to make room for the incredible amount of martyred virginal bones that it now needed to house.Known as the Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber) it is still there today, a massive reliquary filled with dozens of head-busts containing skulls, arm reliquaries, and walls covered in bone. The chamber has been described as a “veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs… arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words.” The church is overflowing with virginal bones, or with some type of bones anyway.Most historians, as well as the Catholic Church, agree that the story of Ursula is probably exaggerated—if not entirely fictional—particularly the number 11,000. Among the explanations is that there was indeed an Ursula who was traveling with 11 virgins, who were indeed martyred. This incident was then abbreviated as E.M.V., then misread by an overeager monk as 11,000. Another explanation is that Ursula was traveling with just one virgin who happened to be named Undecimilla, which read as 11,000. It is also possible that this was a story that had been kicking around in pre-Christian form for some time, and Ursula’s was just the latest incarnation.There is another argument to be made—that the Cologne church came up with the number 11,000 because it meant, for one, that the church would become an even hotter pilgrimage spot than it already was. What’s more, along with the church’s old Roman cemetery, the number 11,000 provided church officials with a nearly endless supply of saints and saintly reliquaries that they could sell for a tidy profit. The entire thing is a sort of early Christian tourist trap, complete with holy tchotchkes.Of course, if this is the case and there were no 11,000 virgins, whose bones are in the church? The answer seems to be everyone and anyone—women, children, men, and even dogs. A Cologne surgeon got in hot water with the church for pointing out that a couple of the head reliquaries contained the skulls, not of virgins, but of large mastiffs.Regardless of whether the bones are those of martyred virgins or regular Romans who happened to get dug up by eager relic-makers, nothing lessens the amazing look of the church or its fantastic reliquary, where skulls are adorned with garlands and coronets (some even retaining tufts of hair). The walls are covered in golden and silver reliquaries, gilded relics abound, and one wall is covered entirely in bone, spelling out the phrase “Holy Ursula, Pray For Us.” It is a truly amazing sight to behold.Ursula left her mark in other ways as well. Besides the Order of Ursulines founded in 1535 to teach young girls, the Virgin Islands were named after her and her band of 11,000 martyred virgins.",A church filled with the bones of hundreds of virgins martyrs—or so they say. ,"Chandelier Hall,St. Petersglocke,Papa Joe's Biersalon Klimperkasten","Ursulaplatz 24 Nordstadt Cologne, 50668",50.9458,6.9544,michellembisonAnnetta BlackmajoungingercinnamondollymaedaggersskyewritergingercinnamonTTheMarmosetpieofthemonthdollymaedaggermmbisonmmajounwytheAnnetta Black,2009-10-25 00:00:00,"St. Petersglocke,Chandelier Hall,Papa Joe's Biersalon Klimperkasten,Cologne's Love Locks Bridge","San Thome Basilica,Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte,The Relic Crypt of St. Helena at Église Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles,The Skeletons of Waldsassen Basilica",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-st-ursula
296,The Reading Pagoda,"pagodas,roadside attractions,architecture",714,999,"Originally the centerpiece of a planned luxury resort, the Pagoda in Reading, Pennsylvania, has become a symbol for the entire town.Built atop Mount Penn in 1908 by local quarry owner William A. Witman, the seven-story Japanese-inspired building was to be the main attraction at a tourist resort. Unfortunately, Witman was unable to obtain a liquor license and the project’s funds dried up, leaving the majestic pagoda as a strangely out-of-place oddity. In 1910, the building and its surrounding ten acres were given over to a local businessman who, recognizing the iconic influence the building was beginning to have on the community, sold the structure and its land to the city of Reading for the sum of $1.Despite some neglect owing to anti-Japanese sentiment during World War II, the city of Reading has restored and cared for the grounds ever since, and the pagoda has indeed become the symbol of the community and has even been put to practical use. Before radio telephony was widespread, lights on the building were used to communicate via Morse code to local emergency workers, and today those same lights flash to alert the children of Reading that Santa is on his way. The building is open for visitors who can take in the picturesque, panoramic view of the city and examine the 16th century Japanese bell that hangs in the top story of the building.The Reading Pagoda may have begun as a gaudy tourist attraction, but it now stands as a testament to a city finding its identity.  ",A failed piece of Orientalism has become the proud symbol of a community. ,"Daniel Boone Homestead,Crystal Cave,Witch's Hat Pavilion","98 Duryea Dr. Reading, Pennsylvania, 19602 United States",40.3361,-75.9056,mselizajaneMartindlc31723ickaimpJane Weinhardt Goldbergloverlee313Matthew H Wardlloverlee313jennsylvaniaMichael Buschdlc31723ickaimpJane Weinhardt GoldbergMMartinRachel,2015-12-21 00:00:00,"Witch's Hat Pavilion,Daniel Boone Homestead,Crystal Cave,Site of the Rhoads Opera House Fire","Pagoda Fine Jewelry,Palsangjeon,Sinsedong Seven-Story Brick Pagoda,Wongaksa Pagoda",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-reading-pagoda-reading-pennsylvania
297,Abney Park Cemetery,"catacombs and crypts,cemeteries",386,999,"Although it is now somewhat overgrown, the original free-thinkers behind Abney Park Cemetery’s unusual design would likely actually be pleased to see their vision of a tree-filled parkland fulfilled.Abney Park was built on 32 acres as one of London’s “Magnificent Seven” Victorian-era park-cemeteries. More park than cemetery, Abney Park Cemetery began as an experiment in mixing the natural delights of an arboretum with a non-denominational burial ground. Specimen trees with names covering all the letters of the alphabet were planted in an informal layout, mixed with shrubs and flowering bushes. Burials were placed between plantings, with no divisions between members of different faiths.Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to the twin pressures of health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries and desires for buildable land in the rapidly expanding city.The design drew inspiration from the recently established Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston, looking for ways both to mix a natural setting with design and symbolism that would promote its origins in the non-conformist movement. Its controversial Egyptian Revival gates provoked some disapproval, setting Abney Park’s style as distinctly different and more eclectic than the traditional NeoClassical or Gothic inspiration from which the other park cemeteries of the era were drawn.True to its original designers’ dreams, Abney Park has evolved into an urban woodland, home to mature trees and diverse fauna and flora. Closed to all but very rare burials, the property is now a Local Nature Reserve and Conservation Area, managed by the Abney Park Trust.","A historic arboretum and non-conformist, non-denominational park cemetery. ","Meeksville Sound Plaque,Clown Egg Register,St Augustine's Tower","Abney Park Cemetery Stoke Newington High Street London, England, N16",51.5648,-0.0781,Annetta BlackBlindcolourMartinSnowdrop68tealeavesmsromanyAlbertoMMelatoSnowdrop68ttealeavesBlindcolourmsromanynormaclydeMMartinRachel,2013-02-18 00:00:00,"Clown Egg Register,St Augustine's Tower,Meeksville Sound Plaque,Get Stuffed","Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery,Crypt of Dr. William Edward Minahan,Warstone Lane Cemetery Catacombs,Grave of W.

Then, film crews, a developing lab, and a gym where actors could bulk up and trim down. Now, it’s a museum tracing the history of the silver screen. In 1914, before Hollywood had a large footprint of permanent studios, filmmakers shot their pictures by repurposing other buildings as sets. It soon became the center of operations for the Jesse L. Lasky Company, which was filming a motion-picture version of the play The Squaw Man.Cecil B. DeMille knew that this barn would make a great addition to the film, the first feature-length movie to be produced in Hollywood. At that point, the barn sat a number of blocks away, near Sunset and Vine. The collaborators continued to operate there as the business grew, eventually swelling into the first home of Paramount Pictures.As operations boomed, the business outgrew its wood-frame confines. But DeMille and company didn’t leave the barn behind. As they moved around Hollywood, and expanded their real estate holdings, they brought the barn with them. By 1926, it had been hauled to a back lot on Melrose Avenue, where Paramount would be building new studios. In the late ’70s, it was firmly out of commission, and was loaded up onto a truck and hauled to a parking lot.In 1985, it finally found a permanent home, near the Hollywood Bowl. Today, it’s a museum, full of archival photos, menus, props, and even a recreation of DeMille’s office, complete with typewriter, film canisters, movie posters, and booze.Also collected are photos and postcards showing the streets and buildings of Tinseltown during its heyday.

299,The Root Bridges of Cherrapunji,"long now locations,bridges,trees,plants,architectural oddities,architecture",89,998,"In the depths of northeastern India, within sight of the India-Bangladesh border, in one of the wettest places on earth, bridges aren’t built—they’re grown.The southern Khasi and Jaintia hills are humid and warm, crisscrossed by swift-flowing rivers and mountain streams. On the slopes of these hills, a species of Indian rubber tree with an incredibly strong root system thrives and flourishes.The Ficus elastica produces a series of secondary roots from higher up its trunk and can comfortably perch atop huge boulders along the riverbanks, or even in the middle of the rivers themselves. The War-Khasis and War-Jaintias, two closely related tribes in Meghalaya, long ago noticed this tree and saw in its powerful roots an opportunity to easily cross the area’s many rivers. Now, whenever and wherever the need arises, they simply grow their bridges.In order to make a rubber tree’s roots grow in the right direction—say, over a river—the people of southern Meghalaya have used several different strategies. Sometimes, the roots of the trees are simply pulled, tied, twisted, and encouraged by hand to merge with each other, until, over time, they form the desired architectural structure. Root bridges have also been made by creating scaffolds out of wood and bamboo, and then training the young roots out across these temporary structures, replacing the more perishable elements many times as they rot in the intense monsoon seasons.In some places, such as around the village of Nongriat, betel nut trunks, sliced down the middle and hollowed out, are used to create root-guidance systems. The thin, tender roots of the rubber tree, prevented from fanning out by the betel nut trunks, grow straight out. The trunks also have the added advantage of providing the roots with additional nutrients as they decay. When they reach the other side of the river, they’re allowed to take root in the soil. Given enough time a sturdy, living bridge is produced.The root bridges can grow for as long as the organism they are a part of remains healthy, though they can take many years to initially become functional, the length of time being dependent on local conditions such as the health of the tree, the way the bridge is being grown, and the availability of nutrients in the soil that its being grown in. However, once root bridges become established, they’re extraordinarily strong—strong enough that some of them can support the weight of 50 or more people at a time. In fact, because they are alive and still growing, the bridges actually gain strength over time—and some of the ancient root bridges used daily by the people of the villages around Cherrapunji may be well over 500 years old. The roots bridges of southern Meghalaya come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They have been known to grow as long as 170 feet, and soar 80 feet above the streams they cross. Most living root bridges only have a single span, yet several have more than one, arranged as either as two parallel spans,  or as two bridges stacked one over the other, such as the famous “Umshiang Double-Decker Root Bridge.”The practice of creating new living bridges, and of preserving ones already in existence, is over large parts of Southern Meghalaya slowly fading out. In many villages across the region, the root bridges are little more than a memory.  However, since they began attracting attention again in around 2004, local dedication to the bridges has, at least in a few places, kept them from being destroyed in favor of steel ones. What’s more, a few new root bridges are currently under construction. In the village of Rangthylliang, an entirely new bridge is being grown using a bamboo and wood scaffold, and at the double-decker site in Nongriat, a new, third span is currently being grown above the other two, and should be ready for use within a decade.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

301,Indian Pueblo Kitchen,"pre-columbian,united states,native american cuisine,indigenous,native americans,history",329,999,"In 1976, the 19 tribes that make up New Mexico’s Pueblo population gathered to open Albuquerque’s Indian Pueblo Cultural Center on a patch of Native American land in the center of the city. This serene complex of stucco buildings is an important arena for the preservation of Native American crafts, music, and ceremonies. It’s also a place where all-too-rare pre-Columbian cuisine is sustained and celebrated, on the menu at Indian Pueblo Kitchen.The year 1492—when Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas—divides the dinner menu. “Post-Contact” options feature all the burgers, salads, and mixed-Mexican options you’d expect from a New Mexican restaurant. The “Pre-Contact” menu, on the other hand, eschews the staple beef, chicken, wheat, butter, sugar, and rice that anchor “American” cuisine altogether; it’s a love letter to New Mexico’s original inhabitants, a smattering of indigenous ingredients upheld and shaped by modern culinary techniques.Diners eating off the Pre-Contact menu can open with a carpaccio, comprised of sumac-seared bison, pickled squash, and pumpkin oil, before moving on to a pot roast of elk shoulder, acorn squash, and wilted wild greens. Another entrée option, the “Tribal Trout,” is pan-seared and served with yam puree, prickly pear syrup, and fried sweet potato strings. Visitors can finish with their wojapi, slow-stewed berries baked under a maple pepita-and-pecan-crumble crust. With its commitment to authenticity, the menu revels in what most modern kitchens might see as a limitation. Indigenous ingredients even spill over into the Post-Contact menu, with dishes such as blue cornmeal–crusted onion rings or salad with fried chicken (also coated in blue cornmeal) and shaved jícama.The menu enacts a collision of the two periods with curios such as fry-bread—reminiscent of the Pueblo Indians’ fat-fried solution to government rations in the 1800s—or fried Kool-Aid pickles, a creative comfort food among the Pueblo.What ingredients the restaurant doesn’t source from local tribes are pulled from the IPCC’s Resilience Garden, a fertile lot where elders teach younger Pueblo generations how to grow endangered crops using traditional farming techniques.

302,Northern State Hospital Farm,"abandoned hospitals,hospitals,farms,parks",268,999,"Established in 1909, the Northern State Hospital for the Mentally Ill was a sprawling and remarkably self-sufficient facility with a number of production facilities including a 700-acre farm.Alongside a lumber mill and quarrying operation, the farm enabled the hospital to support itself. The Northern State Hospital’s farm not only allowed the facility to be self-sufficient, but was even productive enough to help feed other hospitals in the state. The farm had every animal one would expect to see from cows to chickens, and also canning buildings to preserve their stores. In addition to providing food and crops for the facility, the farm also gave the patients a place where they could work and socialize. At its height, the dairy farm was the largest of its kind west of the Mississippi. After the hospital closed in 1973, the farm and its grounds were given to the county to turn into a recreation area. While the hospital buildings are still in use, the farm grounds and their remaining buildings are a public park where visitors can explore the empty barns and milking houses.

303,Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve,"craters,cultures and civilizations,geological oddities,natural wonders,geology,nature",1035,997,"A huge preserve located in the Snake River Plain in Central Idaho, Craters of the Moon is protected because of the area’s many volcanic features that represent one of the best preserved flood basalt areas in the continental United States. At an average elevation of nearly 6,000 feet, Craters of the Moon encompasses three major lava fields and nearly 400 square miles of sagebrush steppe grasslands.Visitors flock to this protected area to see the lava fields, which all sit along the Great Rift of Idaho. Some of the open rift cracks are among the best known anywhere in the world, including the deepest rift on Earth, which measures 800 feet. More than two dozen volcanic cones represent lava flows from between 15,000 and 2,000 years ago.Visitors, though, are encouraged to come prepared. This area is rugged, with only one paved road reaching across the northern end. There is a visitor center, and a highway provides access to it, but hiking through the preserve could be dangerous. All of the plants and animals that grow and live in the area are under environmental stress, as it rarely rains in the preserve, and all of the water is immediately lost to the rifts, where it eventually makes its way to the Snake River. Dry winds constantly work their way across the steppe, and the soil temperature can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit.The preserve also has more than 50 camping sites for visitors. None, though, can be reserved in advance, and they are very basic, including little more than water and trash containers. Campers visit Craters of the Moon in both the summer and the winter, when the Loop Drive is closed to traffic and made available to skiers.While the monument was established way back in May of 1924, the area wasn’t designated the Craters of the Moon National Preserve until August of 2002. Just two years earlier, President Clinton had signed a proclamation that greatly expanded the site to what closely resembles its current shape and size. The area, given its designation, is managed by the National Park Service in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management.",Home to the deepest rift anywhere on Earth. ,"Experimental Breeder Reactor-I,The Devil Boat,The Hemingway Memorial","Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve US 20 Arco, Idaho, 83213",43.4167,-113.5167,sideshowillyNicholas JacksonderukanjiruRedHotRutabagaevilgreentriangleitstomOliverWDahlRedHotRutabagaeevilgreentriangleiitstomCollector of ExperienceserjefferyMagnumPIjjlkirkwoodfalynnkdderukanjiruNicholas Jackson,2011-05-15 00:00:00,"The Devil Boat,Experimental Breeder Reactor-I,The Hemingway Memorial,Ernest Hemingway's Grave","Painted Dunes ,Pingualuit Crater Lake, Prehistoric Trackways National Monument,Vredefort Impact Crater",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/craters-of-the-moon-national-monument-and-preserve

305,Merlin’s Cave,"king arthur,magic,literature,legends,caves,ecosystems,history & culture",433,996,"In the coastal cliffs beneath Tintagel Castle lies an echoingly atmospheric cave. And if the stories of old are to be believed, the cave may once have been home to Merlin, the wizard of Arthurian legend.Most prosaically, Merlin’s Cave is a 330-foot-long sea cave formed by marine erosion. It stretches all the way beneath the craggy head of land on which Tintagel Castle stands, allowing you to enter from one side and exit out the other. It is, without doubt, an impressive cave in its own right.What makes the coastal cavern extra special, however, is its association with the legend of King Arthur and the wizard Merlin. Tintagel Castle has long been linked with King Arthur, as far back as Geoffrey of Monmouth and his book the Historia Regum Britanniae, written circa 1135.Ever since, Tintagel has been connected with Arthur, although many historians argue that the evidence connecting the two (and indeed the very existence of Arthur and co.) is sketchy at best. Either way, people love a good story. And Tintagel has become a physical embodiment of this tale, both the castle above ground and the cave below.The cave and castle gained greater fame following the publication of Tennyson’s Idylls of the King between 1859 and 1885. His cycle of narrative poems retold the legend of King Arthur, and included the tale of the infant Arthur being washed ashore at Merlin’s feet: “They found a naked child upon the sands / Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea; / And that was Arthur; and they fostered him / Till he by miracle was approven King”Today, the cave is inextricably linked to Merlin, so much so that local authorities hired the artist Peter Graham to carve Merlin’s bearded face into a rock near one of the cave entrances. It was immediately a controversial move, with some people calling it vandalism and the dumbing down of British history.Still, it’s there now and people continue to walk down the rocks to explore the sandy-floored cave at low tide, imagining Merlin walking there, carrying the future king in his arms.Update as of June 2022: The entrance to the cave is closed due to rockfall. ",It is said the legendary wizard once lived in this sea cave beneath Tintagel Castle. ,"King Arthur's Hall,Tintagel Castle,Tintagel Post Office","S W Coast Path Tintagel, England United Kingdom",50.6683,-4.7594,Tony Dunnellgingercinnamonwillfaulkner,2018-04-06 00:00:00,"Tintagel Castle,Tintagel Post Office,King Arthur's Hall,Rocky Valley Labyrinths","Kebokwe's Cave,The Ancient Books of Wales,Llyn Barfog,Spar Cave",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merlins-cave
306,The Eagle's Nest ,"nazis,eccentric homes,world war ii,homes,military",475,997,"As the Allies rushed through Western Europe following the German defeat on D-Day, one of the grand prizes to be taken was the infamous Eagle’s Nest. This estate, which sat 6,000 feet high in the Alps, had actually been given to Hitler as a birthday present. The name “Eagle’s Nest” was adopted by the Allies, but it was known throughout Germany as the “Kehlsteinhaus.” It was situated atop the Obersalzberg mountains in one of the most beautiful parts of Bavaria, overlooking the small town of Berchtesgaden.The Eagle’s Nest was designed as a 50th birthday present for Adolf Hitler. Commissioned and overseen by Martin Bormann, the home remains an impressive feat of engineering even today. It was reached by what is still today Germany’s steepest road. Bormann recruited Italian engineers and road makers, experts in carving thoroughfares through the Alps. The steep mountain road ended in a tunnel that was dug into the mountainside, at the end of which was, as there still is today, a gleaming brass elevator. With reserve power still supplied by a U-Boat engine, the elevator would carry guests and its infamous owner to the final summit. The house itself was fairly modest, but luxuriously decorated (the red marble fireplace was a gift from Mussolini), and the views over Germany and Austria were spectacular. In reality however, Hitler rarely set foot in his extravagant present. Rumored to suffer from not only chronic claustrophobia, but also vertigo, Hitler preferred to spend his time in his opulent mansion further down the mountain, the infamous Berghof. The famous photographs of Hitler relaxing in the summer with Eva Braun, his dog, surrounded by children, were all taken down the mountain. Much of the inner circle of the Nazi party also built homes here, as Hitler spent roughly a third of his time in power here. A village for around 2,000 members of the party was constructed, with kilometers of still hidden bunkers and tunnels burrowed into the mountainside beneath them.But the Eagle’s Nest retained such symbolic power that various divisions of the Allied Forces raced each other to be first to Berchtesgaden, then to the mountain top home. Several claim the honor of being first to the Eagle’s Nest, including the French 2nd Armored Division, and more famously, as commemorated in the HBO drama, Band of Brothers, the U.S. 101st Airborne’s Easy Company.In 1960, control of the Eagle’s Nest was handed back to the German government, along with the problem of what to do with it. As with many ex-Nazi sites, there was a worry about preserving a monument for neo-Nazis to visit. And so, the spectacular Eagle’s Nest, Hitler’s 50th birthday gift, was turned into what it is today: a beer garden and restaurant, with little mention of its former notorious owner. The guided tours available however make compulsory stops at a “Documentation Center” at Obersalzberg, a museum that tells the full story of the horrors of the Nazi party era in Germany.At night, in the peaceful, beautiful Alpine town of Berchtesgaden, it is still possible to look up to the mountains soaring high above, and on one of the highest, see a distant twinkling light coming from the Eagle’s Nest. Update as of September 2020: The Eagle’s Nest is closed and will reopen in 2021.","Soaring over 6,000 feet in the Bavarian Alps, this beer garden was once Hitler's 50th birthday present.  ","Eisriesenwelt,Berchtesgaden Salt Mine,The German War Graves of Berchtesgaden","Obersalzberg Berchtesgaden, 83471 Germany",47.6114,13.0421,Luke J SpencerMariCrohrnickCorinaIoanashaw95Tinus,2016-02-10 00:00:00,"Berchtesgaden Salt Mine,The German War Graves of Berchtesgaden,Eisriesenwelt,Schloss Hellbrunn","Du Cane Court,Villa Winter,Castle of Wewelsburg,Villa Rose ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-eagles-nest-berchtesgaden-germany

One tale tells of a young girl who disappeared into the forest, only to reappear five years later unable to remember where she had been. Another legend speaks of a shepherd who, along with his sheep, vanished within the woods. And, with most places associated with the supernatural, there are also rumors of alien encounters.Of course, the forest has so much more to offer than just a dark thrill.

Anywhere, because the Museum of Interesting Things is built to travel.Headquartered in Manhattan’s East Village, the museum is the brainchild of Denny Daniel, a freelance filmmaker and photograph restorer who wanted to use his vast collection of fascinating antique devices to inspire curiosity and innovation.He started with small demonstrations in his apartment, and as people showed more and more interest, the project grew and began to travel. The exhibit is organized by categories, like Math, Science, and Literature, which he takes to schools—elementary through university—as well as hospitals, libraries, and galleries. Any space that is big enough for him to set up a few tables for his antiques is fit for the exhibit. Visitors are encouraged to handle some of the items, to experience what it was like to use them, and make suggestions. (That’s how the collection ended up with three 8-track players.)The idea is to remind people of today that something like the iPhone did not come from nowhere, but evolved over time from history’s innovations. This point is probably driven home when visitors bring out their smartphones to take pictures of his wind-up wooden box telephone. More recently, the exhibit has grown to include several “green power” items, including a crystal radio, which was powered by nothing more than radio waves. ",A hands-on traveling collection of the innovative devices of yesteryear. ,"The Forgotten Entrance to Clinton Hall,Merchant's House Museum,The Brown Building","60 East 8th Street 12P New York, New York United States",40.7306,-73.993,dennydanielxmadisonavenue10Molly McBride Jacobson,2017-05-19 00:00:00,"The Forgotten Entrance to Clinton Hall,The Brown Building,Merchant's House Museum,The Evolution Store","Asa Jackson’s Perpetual Motion Machine,Musée de la Ganterie (Museum of Glove-Making),American Museum of Cutlery,The Royal Armoury",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-interesting-things-new-york-new-york

The entire film cost just over a million dollars to produce, and it was shot in only 28 days – “the gestation time for a water bug,” as Sylvester Stallone so eloquently put it. So choosing locations in Philadelphia meant two things: get it cheap, and get it fast.The iconic scene of Rocky Balboa heroically running the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum was both. Because the scene was filmed with a brand new piece of body-mounted camera equipment called a Steadicam (Rocky was its first commercial use), it allowed for fast and smooth shots with very little setup, and almost no additional equipment or lighting. Rocky ran the steps, the cameraman followed, and it was in the can.There are 72 steps in front of the Art Museum, and since their appearance in Rocky and five of the sequels, they’re now known simply as the “Rocky Steps.” To commemorate their status as a major Philly tourist attraction, the bronze Rocky statue that first made an appearance in Rocky III has been permanently installed at the bottom of the steps. Cast in bronze and weighing in at three tons, it was created by sculptor A. Thomas Schomberg as a commission from Stallone himself for the third film.There is an identical Rocky statue at the Hall of Champions Sports Museum in San Diego. If you want one for yourself, a third casting was planned and put up for auction, but it didn’t reach its asking price of $5 million. The price was dropped a couple of times, but it looks like the piece is still available.

Upon closer inspection, you will find that many buildings and homes still in use today were once Masonic buildings.One such example is Stan Mansion, a grandiose building originally erected in 1923 to house a chapter of the Knights Templar, the Humboldt Park Commandery No. 79. The Knights Templar is one of many fraternal orders affiliated with the Freemasons, dating back to the Crusades in the 18th century.The Temple took just six months to construct, and remained a Masonic lodge for a most of its years. It was eventually purchased by its current owner Cera Stan, who restored the building to its original splendor, and repurposed it as a popular event venue in what’s now Chicago’s Logan Square Historic District. Just next door to Stan Mansion is the historic William Nowaczewski House, a large Queen Anne three-story greystone, replete with a medieval tower, which was built in 1897 and spans three city lots. The home is eye-catching sight to visitors of the area, and still retains many of its original interior features: beautiful inlaid hardwood floors, an ornately carved wooden staircase, stained glass windows and an elaborate lobby rotunda.These grand structures are relics of the golden age of development in the district, which boomed between 1889 and 1930 before the Great Depression hit. During this period well-to-do businessmen built finely crafted mansions along the boulevards that outline Logan Square, many of which have preserved their original late 19th and early 20th century character and architectural styles.

He would teach math, natural philosophy, and geology, as well as serve as the university’s accountant, chaplain, and even acting president. He would complete several geological studies of the Black Mountains, a range of the Appalachians in the western part of the state near the Smoky Mountains. He discovered that this mountain was the highest point in the young United States at 6,684 feet above sea level, rivaling New Hampshire’s Mount Washington by almost 400 feet.However, a former student of his and Representative from Tennessee, Thomas Clingman, disagreed and claimed that the mountain known today as Mount Gibbs was even higher, immediately claiming credit for the true measurement of the highest mountain. Thus, Mitchell would return to the Black Mountains at the age of 62 to reconfirm his findings and defend his prior claim. This excursion would be his last, as he fell from the top of a waterfall and drowned in the pool below. Thereafter called Mitchell Falls, the waterfall is on private property near the park.Elisha Mitchell’s tomb is at the summit of the mountain next to a new observation platform completed in 2009. Mount Mitchell State Park also has campgrounds, a restaurant, and a gift shop and snack bar (this writer recommends the cherry cider). From the parking lot off milepost 355 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, it’s a quick walk up a short paved trail to the summit.

Formed underwater between 10,000 and 100,000 years ago, some of these spires reach to more than 140 feet.Designated a National Natural Landmark in 1968 by the Department of the Interior, the Pinnacles are recognizable to many people because they have been used as a filming location for more than a dozen hit movies, including Planet of the Apes and Star Trek.Once dubbed “Cathedral City,” these ancient formations are classified into four general shapes: towers (taller than they are wide and at least 30 to 40 feet tall), tombstones (stubby and squat), ridges (massive, long sets of ruins), and cones (less than 10 feet tall).Primitive camping methods are permitted around the Trona Pinnacles, but campers are encouraged to use existing campsites and leave little to no trace of the time they spent there. Some hiking trails weave through the area, but sturdy boots are recommended as they are not maintained.

317,Lindow Man ,"bog bodies,mummies,rites and rituals,ruins",894,995,"Sir Francis Bacon once said, “There is nothing more certain in nature that it is impossible for anybody to be utterly annihilated.” Surely this is true for most everything in the universe, but in the case of Lindow Man, it appears to be especially true.In August 1984, workers cutting through a bog discovered the body of a man who was determined by scientists to have died between 2 B.C. and 199 A.D. The man’s skin, hair, and many of his internal organs had been preserved by the bog, left almost completely intact. He was about 25 years old when he died.Well-manicured fingernails and a nicely trimmed beard and mustache suggest this man was most probably not involved in intense manual labor. In-depth analysis has revealed that the man’s last meal included unleavened bread made from wheat and barley. Because investigations have been able to procure information on his health, appearance, and how he might have died, this find has allowed researchers to learn more about this person than any other prehistoric man found in the United Kingdom.But no matter what knowledge this find has supplied archeologists with, one thing is certain: Lindow Man suffered an extremely dreadful demise. He was struck on the head (twice, with a heavy object such as an ax, maybe), and received a brutal blow in the back (perhaps from someone’s knee), which broke one of his ribs. Next, a cord was tied around his neck (which may have strangled him or broke his neck). Lastly, his throat was cut, and he was thrown face down into a pool in the bog.Is Lindow Man proof of a 2,000-year-old homicide or a ritual killing? Some scientists have argued that this man might have been a victim of a human sacrifice carried out by druids.","A naturally mummified 2,000-year-old man. ","Camera Museum,Shield of Parade ,Wolf-God of Woodeaton ","Great Russell Street London, England, WC1B United Kingdom",51.518,-0.127,Madiha BatainehPengwnXoanariadnemazeMonsieur Mictlanreley250Monsieur MictlanXXoanreley250Collector of ExperiencesPPengwnariadnemazeJaszmina SzendreyNicholas Jackson,2010-11-01 00:00:00,"Camera Museum,Shield of Parade ,Wolf-God of Woodeaton ,Mold Gold Cape ","Iñaq Uyu (House of the Virgins of the Sun),Sarcofagi of Carajía,Huaca Pucllana,The Bog Bodies at the Schleswig-Holstein Landesmuseum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lindow-man
318,Public Standards of Length,"industrial revolution,marvelous maps and measures,plaques,technology,science,history",510,995,"This century-and-a-half old brass placard outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was originally installed for Brits eager for a way to officially verify their measuring sticks. Located alongside the Shepherd 24-hour Slave Clock and the green Meridian Laser, an inquisitive visitor can hypothetically calibrate a lab full of scientific instruments using nothing more than this public display. The Public Standards of Length at Greenwich measures the official lengths of the yard, foot, and inch. It was first placed in 1866, and the placard received a “recalibration” every 10 years by the Standard Department of the Board of Trade. The Standards were determined with an obsessive degree of craftsmanship and were designed to be used to their fullest accuracy at 15.5° Celsius. (Any warmer or colder and the rulers’ thermal expansion and contraction gives off a misleading measurement.)Edward Walford’s hefty book Old and New London noted in 1878 how “Any one who desires to secure an accurate yard-measure may do so by carrying to Greenwich a rod about a yard long, and truly adjusting it by means of the appliance there exposed for the public benefit.”In addition to their functional use as public backup rulers, the Standards of Length also had a very important public relations purpose. The work of the Royal Observatory was at times criticized as an expensive scientific boondoggle, lacking in military or economic purpose. The Observatory was eager to highlight the real world benefits of their work, and the plaque was one high visibility way to drive the point home. The notion of a public Standard is very much a product of that time. As the Industrial Revolution spread across the globe, a fortuitous scientific-economy complex spurred the development of increasingly accurate commercial and navigational technology. The exact length of a yard gained increased importance in an era of interoperable parts and mass production.  While the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s astronomers have long since decamped for more isolated facilities, the Public Standards of Length remain as a monument to the virtues of precision, consistency, and interoperability.",19th-century scientists would make the pilgrimage here to verify the precision of their measuring sticks. ,"Tulip Stairs,John Harrison's Marine Chronometers,The Real Greenwich Prime Meridian","Blackheath Ave London, England, SE10 8XJ United Kingdom",51.4779,-0.0013,Elliot CarterJaszmina SzendreyjooniurkadybrownellSEANETTAerjefferyjooniurGavinerjefferySEANETTAkkadybrownellJaszmina Szendrey,2018-01-15 00:00:00,"The Real Greenwich Prime Meridian,John Harrison's Marine Chronometers,Tulip Stairs,The Fan Museum","The Real Birthplace of Silicon Valley,Anders Celsius's Thermometer,Last Home of Descartes,Inkerman Beehive Coke Ovens",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/public-standards-of-length

322,Paronella Park,"architectural oddities,architecture",170,994,"Technically, José Paronella was on his honeymoon with his wife Margarita, but his trip from Spain to Australia in 1925 was also the beginning of years of labor and the creation of a dream estate in a lush jungle.On five hectares (about 12 acres) in North Queensland, Paronella first planted thousands of trees to create the right environment for his vision. He then built the Grand Staircase to help him carry river sand up the hill to make concrete, with which he built first his house, then a grand castle inspired by those of Spain, and installed the oldest hydro-electric dam in North Queensland. Among the park’s features include the theater, foyer and refreshment rooms within the castle, a fountain built by Paronella, and the concrete benches he built next to a beautiful waterfall.After a decade of labor, the park opened in 1935. José Paronella continued to labor tirelessly on the park, fixing it after a bad flood in 1946, until his death in 1948. He had been laboring on the park for the last 21 years. Without his tireless energy, it became difficult to upkeep the park and over the years, the park was badly damaged by natural disasters; floods, fires and a cyclone decimated it. Though José’s children and grandchildren continued to own and care for the park for many years, by 1977 the park was sold. After a fire struck in 1979, and Cyclone Winifred in 1986, the park was closed for good.But, in 1993, the Park was purchased by Mark and Judy Evans and reopened to the public. The Evans see their role as that of maintaining and preserving the great work of art created by José Paronella. The park now operates tours throughout the day, as well as a spectacular evening tour. They recommend you spend at least three hours exploring both the natural and man-made wonders, from the grand staircase and castle to the waterfall and magnificent flowers.Paronella Park has won numerous tourism awards and was listed as a National Trust in 1997. Additionally, in 2008, they updated the hydro-electric system, which generates all the power for the park and puts power back into the grid for neighboring towns.To seal this Hollywood ending, Australian director Ben Hackworth plans to make a feature film of the history of the park.Admission to the park includes a night stay in their caravan park, annual admission, guided tours, and two maps.",A castle hand built by a Spanish dreamer in the Australian tropical jungle. ,"Hou Wang Temple,Marineland Melanesia,Cairns Library Bats","Japoonvale road Mena Creek, 4871 Australia",-17.6567,145.9563,mbisonRebekah OttoFubulousmichelleBlindcolour,2009-08-02 00:00:00,"Hou Wang Temple,Cairns Library Bats,Marineland Melanesia,Undara Lava Tubes","The Japanese-Style House of Prospect Park South,Herz-Jesu-Kirche,Castillo Pittamiglio,Murtoa Stick Shed",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paronella-park

The subterranean complex is located underneath the Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America, with a Dan Brown-style entrance near the main altar and the bones of a boy martyr inside.However, the Catacombs of Washington, D.C., aren’t quite as ancient as the name would suggest, and all but one of the graves are totally fake. They were built at the turn of the 20th century by a well meaning group of Franciscan monks who wanted to create a facsimile of the Holy Land for North Americans who couldn’t afford the trip overseas.These catacombs do have an official Papal endorsement and contain one very real skeleton of what looks to be a seven or eight-year-old child. Legend holds that the bones belong to a martyr from the second century and made their way to D.C. from the Catacomb of St. Callistus in 1929.Above the catacombs the Franciscans also brought together a sort of spiritual amusement park, complete with replicas of the tomb of Jesus and numerous other altars, chapels, and grottos from the Old World. Visitors can complete a veritable world tour of Roman and Middle Eastern religious shrines in a single afternoon. A Roman architect named Aristides Leonori produced the design for a mini-catacomb based on measurements and photographs of the originals in Italy. Three architecturally distinct sections represent various chapters from early Christian lore. Unlike the Roman originals, which were scraped from the earth and soft rock by hand two millennia ago, the D.C. catacombs were cast from aggregate cement and come in at a spry 120 years of age. They’re also much smaller in scale: essentially three interconnected arcades, as opposed to the hundreds of miles that stretch beneath Rome.

It’s not Bangkok; it’s a parking lot in Los Angeles.Since the 1980s, this weekend-only food market has sold some of the best Thai food outside of Thailand. What began as a handful of Thai grandmothers getting together to share their family recipes and renditions of homeland classics evolved into a weekly transformation of the Wat Thai Temple’s parking lot into a bustling Thai street scene, with a portion of the profits going to the temple itself.By the mid-2000s, however, the market had outgrown itself, with parking and garbage issues drawing heavy complaints from neighbors. In 2007, the city shut down the temple’s weekly food-fair, to the chagrin of the devout following the temple had accrued over the years.In 2015, the market returned, once again selling everyone’s Thai favorites—meaty larb, sweet coconut fritters, fried bananas, and sour Isaan sausage—as well as some off-the-beaten-path dishes that never quite attained pad Thai–level fame, such as mussel pancakes with sweet-and-sour sauce, fried potato balls, and kanom krok, a pan-fried ball of rice flour and coconut milk.Nothing comes closer to true Thai street food outside Thailand than this market.

That is, if you measure from Mauna Kea’s peak to its base on the Pacific Ocean floor.While Mauna Kea is only 13,803 feet above sea level (compared to Everest’s 29,029 feet), the summit of the Hawaiian shield volcano is a staggering 30,000 feet above its base on the sea floor. Using this measurement isn’t likely to change many minds about Everest, but Mauna Kea may still be considered the world’s tallest volcano.It is one of five separate shield volcanoes that make up the Big Island of Hawai’i. It is so large that the mountain is gradually sinking into the sea floor under the pressure of its own weight.Mauna Kea’s summit is a landscape to behold: it includes lava rock, alpine tundra, and evidence of the humongous ice cap that dominated the terrain as recently as 11,000 years ago. Above the timberline and above the clouds, the summit is home to a select few, including the Hawaiian snow goddess Poliahu and oxygen-deprived astronomers hoping to use some of the world’s most advanced telescopes.The summit is so high that altitude sickness is a problem for many, and tourists are encouraged to make extended stops on their drive up to allow their body to adjust. But for determined astronomers, dizziness and shortness of breath are a small price to pay for some of the best observing conditions on Earth.Here observers are treated to approximately 300 clear nights per year, due to the fact that the summit rests above 40 percent of the Earth’s atmosphere (including the inversion layer) and 90 percent of its water vapor. And with the site’s location 20 degrees north of the equator, all of the northern sky is visible as well as a majority of the stars in the southern sky. For these reasons, Mauna Kea has been an astronomically important site since observers of ancient times marveled at its incredibly clear view of the night sky. Today, there are over a dozen major telescopes at the site, which is managed by the University of Hawai’i.In fact, four of the largest optical reflecting telescopes in the world are atop Mauna Kea. These are the two 10-meter telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory, the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope, and the 8.1-meter Gemini North Observatory. On a plateau north of the summit, work has begun to build the Thirty Meter Telescope, which will be the largest optical and infrared telescope in the world.Not to be overshadowed by the collection of record-holding mirrors, a host of other world-class instruments reside at Mauna Kea. These include the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), Canada France Hawai’i Telescope (CFHT), NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), two University of Hawai’i telescopes, and one receiver of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA).The very summit of the mountain and the highest point in Hawai’i can be seen from the topmost parking lot and is just a 15-minute walk away. Walk down the paved road to the guardrail with a hiker sign, and follow the trail to the summit ahu (cairn).For Native Hawaiians, Mauna Kea is one of the most sacred places on the islands, and many view construction on its peak as an affront to their rights over their ancestral lands. In Hawaiian tradition, the mountain is an ancestor of Native Hawaiians, or Kanaka Maoli.

Using a chainsaw, he has created a variety of carvings ranging from a simple face to detailed fairy houses and a majestic dragon.Hunting for the carvings makes for a fun, whimsical walk through the park. They’re scattered throughout the area, and each one even has its own brief, fictional back story. Some of Muir’s creations are easily visible from the main path that leads to the castle. A few others, however, are on more rural trails that require a bit of off-road exploration throughout the woods. A new carving can appear at any time, making it easy to spend hours in the park looking for new discoveries while also enjoying the castle, the views, and the beauty of Loch Lomond.Muir began crafting his carvings after becoming tired of leaving boring stumps in the wake of the diseased and dying trees he felled.

Climbing overhead, the Nepenthes pitcher plants (also known as ‘monkey cups’) survive on a diet of insects lured into their flower like opening, then trapped by the slick walls and lowered into a stew of digestive enzymes in the base of the cup. Named for the mythological elixir of the Egyptians given to Helen of Troy to erase her sorrows in Homer’s Odyssey, the name means ‘without sorrow’ in Greek.According to the Conservatory information: “In some cultures, the pitchers have been used as vessels for cooking rice or gathering water. The sterile fluid from unopened pitchers reportedly has been used as an eyewash, asthma reliever or painkiller during childbirth. Various parts of the plant have also been used to treat indigestion, heartburn, stomach ailments and dysentery.”The building itself was first discovered in parts amongst the property of a wealthy local business man who died before it could be built.

334,Kensal Green Cemetery and Catacombs,"memento mori,catacombs and crypts,cemeteries",516,2828,"Kensal Green is the one of the oldest public burial grounds and the first of the “Magnificent Seven” Victorian garden cemeteries built in the suburbs of London in the 19th century.Comprised of Kensal Green, Highgate, West Norwood, Abney Park, Nunhead, Brompton, and Tower Hamlets cemeteries, the Magnificent Seven were created beginning in 1832 as part of an effort to move burials out of the City of London in response to twin pressure of health concerns about overcrowded churchyard cemeteries as well as desires for buildable land in the quickly expanding city.Rapid population growth and a cholera outbreak in London in the 1830s hastened plans to offers an alternative to small crowded churchyards within the city, with large new cemeteries on the outskirts of town. Inspired by the model created at Père Lachaise in Paris (est. 1804), London’s garden cemeteries set out to design burial grounds with inviting landscaping, shady trees, and winding paths. The Kensal Green cemetery opened in 1833; most of the first 54 acres were consecrated by the Church of England, with a small Dissenters’ Section for other sects and religions at the western end. The cemetery now covers 72 acres (29 hectares) in northwest London, bounded by Harrow Road to the north, Ladbroke Grove to the west, the Paddington Canal to the south, and St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Cemetery to the east.The new cemeteries gained popularity in the Victorian period, with their elaborate rituals surrounding death and mourning. After the funeral of HRH The Duke of Sussex, sixth son of George III, in 1843, and that of his sister HRH Princess Sophia in 1848, Kensal Green in particular became the most fashionable burial ground in the country if not the empire, attracting literally hundreds of titled aristocrats, numerous celebrities, and the aspiring middle classes. Many of the tombstones and mausoleums of the period are enormous and lavish, with areas for visitors to loiter. The crushing death toll of WWI led to less ostentatious funerals and memorial decorations, and the growing popularity of cremation brought the heyday of the garden cemetery to an end. With their decline in popularity came an overall decline in conditions. Aerial bombardment did some damage in WWII, and by the 1960s, they were best known for their spooky overgrown and ramshackle appearance.In recent decades, volunteers have helped to clear and restore monuments and chapels at Kensal Green, which now has some 140 listed buildings and monuments. The cemetery holds some 65,000 graves, and still retains a romantic atmosphere, with mature trees and magnificent monuments along the main carriageways, overgrown paths, and tumbled tombstones in the byways.Many notable people are buried at Kensal Green, among them Charles Babbage* (of Difference Engine fame), engineers Sir Marc Isambard Brunel and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, authors William Makepeace Thackeray, John Gould, Wilkie Collins and Anthony Trollope, playwrights Terence Rattigan and Harold Pinter, merchants Andrew Pears, W.H. Smith and William Whiteley, painters William Mulready and J.W. Waterhouse, as well as Lady Wilde and Lady Byron, Winston Churchill’s daughter, and Charles Dickens’ in-laws.The catafalque and hydraulic lift in the Anglican Chapel have been restored to working order, although an appeal is now underway to restore the building itself. The Anglican Chapel (and the catacomb beneath it) and Dissenter’s Chapel can be visited on the regular Sunday afternoon tours led by the Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery.*Not all of Babbage is buried at Kensal Green.

335,The Narrows,"national parks,rivers,water",1078,2757,"The trek through the Narrows of Zion National Park is a stunning sight: The path can be as skinny as 20 feet wide, while the vertical red canyon walls shoot up to 2,000 feet high on either side. It’s considered one of the best hikes in the world — but be prepared to get very wet. Slot canyons, narrow canyons that are drastically taller than they are wide, are often on the bucket list for intrepid hikers. However, although they are formed over time by water rushing through rock, only a few still have a river running through them. That’s what makes the Narrows so legendary.The hike through the Narrows, located on the North Fork of the Virgin River in Utah’s Zion Park, starts at the section of the canyon known as the Temple of Sinawava, and ranges from two to sixteen miles depending on the route. The trek will simultaneously delight your eyes with one of the most beautiful sights imaginable and drench your clothes with cold water. This is because, for a third of the hike, the Virgin River fills the Zion Canyon from wall to wall, forcing hikers to slosh through the water atop slippery rocks to move forward, sometimes submerged as much as chest deep. Adventurers looking for a real challenge will attempt the Narrows in the spring, when the snowmelt makes for even higher water levels, although if the flow rate reaches 120 cubic feet per second the river is closed off to tourists. Hiking through a slot canyon is not without its risk. Despite the dry climate of the American Southwest, the number one danger is the canyon filling with too much water. During a rain storm, the water level can rise quickly in such a narrow space. Tragically, 11 tourists drowned in Utah’s Antelope Canyon in 1997 when the water level rose in the tight, inescapable pit. Despite the risk, thousands of adventurers wade through the Narrows every day. After two hours of hiking through the river, trekkers will reach “Wall Street,” a deep, dramatic canyon — appropriately named, considering its wealth of good views.","The hike through a narrow river flanked by the 2,000-foot-tall walls of Zion Canyon is one of the best in the world. ","Checkerboard Mesa,Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel,Grafton Ghost Town","Temple of Sinawava Zion National Park Springdale, Utah, 84767",37.2867,-112.9477,lewblankevilgreentriangleheems79shaw95WhiskeyBristlesDr Alan P Newmaneevilgreentriangleheems79Dr Alan P NewmanWhiskeyBristleslleslipetersonsshaw95,2016-06-08 00:00:00,"Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel,Checkerboard Mesa,Grafton Ghost Town,Maurice Graham Monument","Isa Lake,Glenaladale Weir,Charco Azul,Koshi Barrage",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narrows

Ott gave a remarkable concert for the Buckwampum Historical Society. What made the concert remarkable wasn’t the music being played but the instrument Ott was playing. The instrument was made of stones that made “clear, bell-like tones” when struck by a hammer. You might say it was the first rock concert.Ott procured the musical rocks from a nearby boulder field in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania. Known today as Ringing Rocks Park, the rock field occupies 7 acres of an otherwise wooded area, and is over 10 feet deep with boulders.Only about a third of the rocks ring, and for a long time why the rocks rang at all was unclear. However, in 1965 a group of scientists crushed, broke, and sliced the rocks. After performing numerous tests, they found that while all the rocks do in fact ring, they often do so at tones lower than the human ear can perceive. Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which they ring still remains elusive. (It may have to do with the freeze-thaw cycle that helped create the boulder field in the first place.)You can listen to the sounds of these mysterious rocks below.Though many are tempted to illegally pocket a ringing rock for later use, it is futile, as the rocks lose their musical ability once taken away from the other stones.",Mysterious rocks that ring musically when struck. ,"Green Sergeant's Covered Bridge,Rosicrucian Pyramids of Bucks County,The Famous River Hot Dog Man","Ringing Rocks Road Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania, 18972 United States",40.5625,-75.1343,Dylanecfuzapman1Jane Weinhardt Goldbergtrexbeverlywythe55qmbcxnkwyfranklclevelandecfujjulieamassadlc31723trexbeverlyddalmationgirl42Jane Weinhardt Goldbergzzapman1Leslie McIntyreFFacebook775808477mmbisonHHenrywythe,2010-05-29 00:00:00,"The Famous River Hot Dog Man,Rosicrucian Pyramids of Bucks County,Green Sergeant's Covered Bridge,Hoover-Mason Trestle","Ringing Rocks of Montana,Singing Sand Dunes of Liwa,Booming Dunes of Badain Jaran Desert,Musical Stone of Gobustan",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sonorous-stones-ringing-rocks-park

Rising 90 feet from the valley floor, it could only be accessed by ladders, which, when pulled away, provided safety for the tribe from any intruder—man or beast—with unsavory motives.There was a time when visitors were permitted inside to have a look around, but limestone is soft, and thousands of stomping feet are destructive, so within a few years of its protected status as a National Monument, the public was kept out, in order to preserve it.

Located on the Willis Tower’s 103rd floor Skydeck, the observation perches have walls, floors, and ceilings made entirely of glass, allowing visitors to jut out from the edge of the building to enjoy a unique and vertigo-worthy view of Chicago’s architectural landscape.Though the building is now officially known as the Willis Tower after being acquired in 2009, it’s still commonly referred to by its former name, the Sears Tower. It’s the 14th-tallest building in the world with 110 stories constituting 1,450 feet. The glass cubes, called “the Ledges,” were opened to the public in 2009. Each of the four compartments measure ten feet by ten feet and protrude 4.3 feet from the edge of the tower.With three layers of glass totaling one-and-a-half inches thick, each platform can support up to five tons.

All the side and bottom perimeter steel was removed, completing the floating-on-air appearance.The idea for the Ledges supposedly originated from the constant cleaning workers had to do on Skydeck’s windows. Every day, tourists would press their foreheads against the glass, attempting to peer down at the city, leaving smudges that were becoming tedious to clean.

These are usually larger zoological species that, to date, remain unverified by science, such as Yetis, Bigfoot, Lake Monsters, and Sea Serpents, as well as hundreds of other yet-to-be-found animals (cryptids) worldwide…” It also encompasses the study of animals of recent discovery, such as the coelacanth, okapi, megamouth shark, giant panda, and mountain gorilla.”Throughout the years, Coleman has amassed an unrivaled collection of specimens, replicas, and artifacts relating to famous and lesser-known cryptids, including the eight-and-a-half-foot tall, 300-pound “Crookston Bigfoot,” a life-size coelacanth, a replica of P.

In the late 18th century, Mitchell Clay moved his young family west, and they established an 800-acre farm near Lake Shawnee where they raised 14 children. In August of 1783, a Shawnee band killed three of the Clay children. Mitchell Clay tracked down the band who had raided his farm and killed several of its members in bloody retaliation. The event became known as the Clover Bottom Massacre.Many years later, the amusement park was opened in 1926 to cater to the families of nearby coal workers. After the death of two children on the park grounds, the funfair closed in 1966, leaving behind many of its rickety wood and steel rides.The rusting Ferris wheel and children’s swing stand like dead trees among the unkempt wildlife.

350,Mosaic Tile House,"mosaics,outsider architecture,eccentric homes,homes,architectural oddities,architecture",361,2664,"Venice Beach is known for its boardwalk filled with colorful, eccentric people. The houses, buildings, and structures that dot this area also reflect this “rainbow coalition” of people. From simple beach bungalows to ultramodern homes, Venice is truly a unique place to live. But none of these places quite capture the effervescent essence of Venice like the Mosaic Tile House. Though it’s not well known to the public, the moment you enter this large-scale artwork-in-progress structure, it’s like walking inside a coral reef. Most of the tiles are in the red, yellow, and orange spectrum, but bold colors radiate throughout the space. Almost every square inch of the home (including the outside) is covered in mosaic tiles. Cheri Pann and Gonzalo Duran, a husband and wife team, are responsible for this local masterpiece. Pann is the docent guide if you visit.Pann and Duran’s “visual feast” began as a weekend project to install bathroom tiles, and it later developed into a lifetime love affair that’s lasted more than two decades. Cheri is an artist who creates contemplative large-scale oil paintings with mythic themes, and Gonzalo, canvases in vignettes of their life together. For the house, Cheri creates the tiles, and Gonzalo shatters them and distributes them over every square inch of their home. Since 1994, the couple has been transforming their once bland, beige stucco home into the structural kaleidoscope that it exists as today. The Mosaic Tile House is still a work in process–there are still sections where it has not yet been completely covered in tiles–but what is completed is more than enough to give the average person a visual overload. What might catch your attention is a fruit tree and vegetable garden incorporated into all the tile landscaping, and a black fridge stuffed with dolls that Pann has described as the dark part of her imagination.So if you ever find yourself visiting Venice, once you’ve had your fill of Abbot Kinney and the Boardwalk, head east a mile or so, and visit the Mosaic Tile House. ",Rainbow-hued local gem in Venice. ,"Beyond Baroque,Whimsical Metal Sculptures on Palms and Marco Place,Kinney-Tabor House"," 1116 Palms Blvd Los Angeles, California, 90291 United States",34.0,-118.4568,rjhemedesAvoiding Regretadriennespymaryn67Rachelkelleytravelscaedeskkelleytravelsaadriennespymmaryn67Avoiding RegretRachel,2013-11-19 00:00:00,"Whimsical Metal Sculptures on Palms and Marco Place,Beyond Baroque,Kinney-Tabor House,Peano's Faces of Venice Beach","Whale House,El Nido de Quetzalcóatl,Géró Udvar,House of Francisco González",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mosaic-tile-house

Each streetcar is pulled along a huge continuous loop of cable, which is constantly turned by a giant spinning sheave. These enormous sheaves - wheels with grooves along their edges for holding cable - can be seen working away at the Cable Car Museum, always moving the huge loops of cable running under Hyde, Mason, California, and Powell streets.Streetcars move by clamping onto the cable and being pulled forward. Car operators must quickly let go of the cable when taking certain turns or when one cable car crosses another, and then quickly clamp on again. The cables, sheaves, and cars must be kept in excellent condition to avoid runaway streetcars, of which there have been only a handful in the history of the city.Exhibits show the history of both cable and streetcar systems in the city, with their competing companies and routes, along with the story of how the system was saved from the post-WWII threat of replacement by buses. There are also full size and model cars.The Museum’s mezzanine offers a subterranean glimpse beneath the city streets of the cables, sheaves, gears, and electric motors that run the system.",Not merely a museum – but a whirring powerhouse that offers a subterranean peek into the heart and soul of cable car operations. ,"The Tonga Room,Fairmont San Francisco Penthouse Suite,AIDS Interfaith Memorial Chapel","1201 Mason Street San Francisco, California, 94108 United States",37.7945,-122.4114,ShalacopaulmisonMark MonesRaianYwytheAnnetta BlackRRaianYmateMMark MonespaulmisonMark CaseywytheAnnetta Black,2010-05-01 00:00:00,"The Tonga Room,Fairmont San Francisco Penthouse Suite,AIDS Interfaith Memorial Chapel,Hang Ah Tea Room","London Transport Museum,Carpetana Metro Station Museum,Vespa Museum,National Capital Trolley Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/san-francisco-s-cable-car-museum-2

Or is it waste not, haunt-not? Only the owners would know.  Though it may look like a typical stone house, its foundation has macabre origins. The building was constructed in 1934 from the bottom half of government-issued marble tombstones that previously topped the graves of Union soldiers in Poplar Lawn Cemetery.The soldiers all died in the siege of Petersburg, which lasted for nine months at the end of the Civil War. They were eventually buried at Poplar Lawn Cemetery. After their original wooden grave markers rotted away, the government installed upright marble headstones to take their place.However, during the Great Depression, maintaining the cemetery and the headstones suffered because of scant funding. The city decided to cut the tombstones in half and lay the top halves, which were engraved with the soldiers’ details, on the ground so they no longer stood erect. These makeshift flat graves saved money on mowing and maintenance costs. The bottom halves of 2,200 slain tombstones were then sold for the princely sum of $45. Their new owner, Oswald Young, used them to build his house, chimney, and walkway.

However, because Confusion Hill is a self-guided tour, rather than the tightly controlled tours at other mystery spots, you have the opportunity to explore the forced perspective, Ames room illusion to the fullest. Among the illusions are rolling a golf ball out the window and having it come back to you, standing on the walls, and a gravity chair, which is easy to get into and difficult to get out of.The other attractions on Confusion Hill, are appropriately confusing, and include a “Redwood Shoehouse” which was used as a float in a 1947 parade, and has been on the hill since 1949 when Confusion Hill was originally built. It also boasts the largest freestanding Redwood Chainsaw Carving at over 40 feet tall, and a mountain train ride on a 20 gauge track.Unfortunately, though Confusion Hill is located amid a redwood forest, much of the forest has been logged leading one commentator to say that it looked like “a nuclear bomb decimated the redwood forests.”",An optical illusion found amid a logged redwood forest. ,"Hobbiton, USA,Enchanted Forest,Chandelier Tree","75001 N.

361,Off the Rez Cafe,"native american cuisine,native americans,restaurants,Unique Restaurants & Bars,museums",194,991,"The U.S. government’s forced relocation of Native American communities in the 1800s not only separated countless families from their ancestral homelands, but severed ancient food cultures from their traditional food sources. The government threw flour, sugar, and lard at the hunger of the displaced, with which a staple of modern Native American cuisine was born. The deep-fried, doughy pillows called frybread are viewed today by some as a relic of oppression, but many others as a symbol of resilience.In a twist of historic irony, frybread now anchors the menu at Off the Rez, one of Washington State’s few Native American–owned restaurants. If that’s not enough to chew on, it’s in a museum celebrating the region’s natural and cultural history.Off the Rez co-owner Mark McConnell grew up eating frybread made by his mother, a member of the Blackfeet Nation. When he and his partner, Cecilia Rikard, launched a Seattle-area food truck—also called Off the Rez—in 2011, they sold showy renditions of reservation classics. Powwow burgers (beef, bacon, cumin crema, and pickled red onions on frybread), Indian tacos (frybread with pulled pork or chili), and sweet frybreads with an array of sweet toppings (Nutella is a crowd favorite) earned them somewhat of a cult following over the years. After the Burke Museum tapped the couple to open a brick and mortar cafe within their newly renovated building, the offerings took on a broader scope.In a sleek, brightly lit 30-seat cafe, diners can choose from all the food-truck classics locally known and loved as well as an expanded menu of pre-colonial dishes. Hyper-local, traditional ingredients are on display in customizable wild rice bowls, braised bison tacos on frybread, and a sweet potato salad with peppers, corn, and dijon dressing. Their 12-hour pulled pork makes a case for post-colonial foods, while a chipotle coleslaw expands  the “Native” radius.Whatever you get, be sure to grab a bite before you go into the museum.

Curtis King embraced this extraterrestrial vibe and built the Spaceship House for his son in 1972, tucking it away in the woods near Signal Mountain, Tennessee.Complete with a drop-down staircase to enter the elevated spacecraft, the house had every detail to channel futuristic living and cost $250,000 to build. Along with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the house was furnished with a full bar and entertainment area. Every room and most pieces of furniture in the house are rounded, giving the entire home a strange circular style.Made of steel and concrete, the structure provides nearly 2,000 square feet of living space. A retractable staircase serves as the entrance to the house, but it is broken and remains in the “down” position. A neighbor says that feature came in handy for one former owner who was having an argument with her husband. She pulled up the stairway, drove her husband’s truck underneath it so he couldn’t get the stairs down and left him stuck inside.King and his family sold the house, and it changed hands many times throughout its life. In 2008, the latest property owner put up the Tennessee landmark for auction and it was purchased by a Signal Mountain local for $120,000.

363,Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Museum,medical museums,319,990,"The Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary was a family business founded in 1792 by Edward Stabler. It operated continuously on this spot until 1933, when competition from synthetic drug companies and new food & drug regulations finally caused the business to go bankrupt. After the apothecary closed in 1933, it reopened as a museum in 1939. The bottles and instruments on display, along with their contents, are the originals from when the store closed, offering a snapshot of the operation of America’s oldest apothecary.Having apprenticed under his brother in Leesburg, Virginia, Edward Stabler came to Alexandria to start his own apothecary in 1792. Quickly establishing himself, Edward sold to a range of people both in the city and in the surrounding area - on display in the museum are company ledgers showing purchases from Robert E. Lee and Martha Washington, to name two famous examples. Besides medicines, Stabler sold items such as farm and garden equipment, surgical and dental instruments, soap, perfume, cigars, paint, varnish, artist’s supplies, combs, brushes, and other useful items. Much of the medicine was produced on-site in the upstairs workshop. At the height of the business in 1865, the apothecary owned 11 buildings and warehouses throughout the city and supplied nearly 500 pharmacies in the Washington, DC area. The apothecary remained a family affair, passing from Edward to his son, William, and then eventually to William’s brother-in-law John Leadbeater, who added his name to the business.Eventually facing competition from synthetic drug companies, new food & drug regulations, and the economic downturn, the apothecary went bankrupt and was forced to close its doors in 1933. Recognizing the historic significance of the site, however, the site and its contents were purchased at auction by L. Manuel Hendler, a Baltimore ice cream merchant. The Landmarks Society of Alexandria was formed and the re-opened the site as a museum in 1939. The containers, bottles, and ingredients on display are the same ones that were in the apothecary when it closed, offering a unique snapshot in the life of an apothecary shop. Given the 141-year history of the shop, spanning the first days of the nation to the years between the world wars, the unique artifacts on display provide an important window to history.",An original apothecary from 1792. ,"Gadsby's Tavern,Carlyle House Historic Park,The Elk of Prince Street","105-107 South Fairfax Street Alexandria, Virginia, 22314 United States",38.8042,-77.0427,DylanHenrybeckaRoadUnraveledAvi BbryanwoernerRoadUnraveledbbeckaPatTheGreatccjstappbryanwoernerHHenryAAvi B,2011-08-25 00:00:00,"The Elk of Prince Street,Carlyle House Historic Park,Gadsby's Tavern,First Lot Sold At Auction Marker","Martha and Marie,Museum of the Central Hospital of Porto,Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry,Raeapteek",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stabler-leadbeater-apothecary-museum

Shortly thereafter, games such as Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, and The Legend of Zelda became household names around the world.It’s no surprise that Japan, a powerhouse of the video game industry, especially during the early ’80s, would have establishments celebrating this history. In fact, the country as a whole and Tokyo in particular have a plethora of video game–themed establishments, but not many quite like the 8bit Cafe.

The home was destroyed by fire on Christmas Day in 1884, and since has been left as a ruin, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1969.  With conservation undertaken by the Zonin family, owners of Barboursville Vineyards, the ruins of Barboursville are now open to the public on a regular basis. Barbour’s home was built in the first quarter of the 19th century with completion at least by 1822.  It was based on designs by his close friend and political ally, Thomas Jefferson, who provided workmen from his own Monticello home. The eight-room home was not the most ostentatious house, but it was grand in its own way, with multiple two-story chambers and featured an octagonal drawing room and portico very similar those at Monticello. There was also supposed to be a large dome added to the top of the house, but this feature was eliminated while the house was being built. While the house itself was not extraordinarily large, the boxwood gardens surrounding were impressive.The 1884 Christmas Day fire destroyed everything but the brick walls, the interior masonry partitions and the grand fluted columns. Today the ruins are on the grounds of Barboursville Winery, one of the oldest and most prestigious wineries in Virginia.  Adjacent to the ruins, another Barbour building has been renovated as the 1804 Inn and an even earlier building provides lodging as The Cottage. While there aren’t too many presidents passing through the estate’s halls these days, they are the site of a number of weddings which take advantage of the history and magnificence of the Barboursville Ruins. ",The ruins of this Thomas-Jefferson-designed mansion have been left to crumble since the Christmas Day they burnt down. ,"Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia,Montpelier Horse Cemetery ,Gordonsville Fried Chicken Festival","17434-17498 Mansion Rd Barboursville, Virginia, 22923 United States",38.1625,-78.2807,lcbudd14Collector of ExperiencesShutterShelledebstubbsblimpcaptainrugby007,2015-12-04 00:00:00,"Gordonsville Fried Chicken Festival,Montpelier Horse Cemetery ,Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia,Monticello's Vegetable Garden and Fruitery","Kilmacurragh House,Ungru Manor,Chester A.

Andrea and Rolf, the owners and curators, have been collecting shakers for more than 25 years, and they are thrilled to be able to share their knowledge on the topic with the world. Andrea, formerly an archaeologist, is the shaker expert, while Rolf curates and maintains the museum’s collection of pepper mills, of which they have about 1500. The couple are keen to impart some of the history and functionality of salt and pepper shakers, lest any visitor walk away wondering “why?”Of the many interesting facts the museum sheds some light on, the reasoning behind the number of holes per shaker seems to the most requested bit of info. As the operators of the museum will tell you, it depends on everything from the local culture’s view of salt and pepper in terms of health, the size of the spice grain, and even simple availability.

374,Frank Lloyd Wright's Burnham Block,"frank lloyd wright,places to stay,houses,homes,architectural oddities,architecture",302,988,"These small houses feel very much like miniature versions of Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous homes for the rich. They too have flat roofs, central hearths, and lots of wood, though it’s cheap gumwood stained to look like walnut. The bedrooms are tiny, and the kitchen in one house is so awkward that you’re in danger of falling down a staircase when you open the fridge.Every house Wright ever built is grander than the tiny homes he built on the western edge of Milwaukee, but arguably none is more ambitious. In the early years of the 20th century, Wright fixated on the problem of economical, excellent housing for working people. In 1915, he thought he solved it.Wright teamed up with Milwaukee developer Arthur L. Richards on a grand plan to build wonderful houses for low and middle-income Americans. Wright conceived and designed what he called American System-Built Homes, a collection of almost-but-not-quite-pre-fab small houses. Wright and Richards intended to turn American System-Built Homes into a huge enterprise, competing with Sears Catalog Houses.Between 1915 and 1917, Wright churned out more than 900 drawings and more than 30 house models. (The man who would build “Fallingwater” and “Usonia” uncharacteristically gave these houses less-than-evocative names like “Model B1” and “Model C3.”)Richards chose the 2700 block of W. Burnham Street in southwestern Milwaukee to test the concept. He completed six houses on the block quickly; two one-story houses of fewer than 1,000 square feet, and four two-story houses, each of which contained two apartments. The one-story house sold for $3,000, which was more than Sears houses, but way less than architect-designed homes of the time.But unfortunately, the American System-Built Homes failed to revolutionize American housing, and they were a fiasco as a business. Wright and Richards immediately had a falling out, with Wright successfully suing the developer for non-payment. Only about a dozen of the houses were ever built: the six on Burnham Street and others scattered in Wisconsin and Illinois.The Burnham block houses were largely forgotten by Wright fans and gradually altered by their owners. Porches were enclosed. One owner clad their house in vinyl siding, which caught the attention of Wright admirers and horrified them. Another owner replaced the flat roof with a Pizza-Hut-style red roof.In recent years, a nonprofit called Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block has been buying up the houses and restoring them. They now own four of them, including the Pizza Hut-esque house and the one shielded with siding. They’ve fully restored one and as of mid-2018 are partway through the restoration of a second, which they plan to rent out for overnight stays. (You can also spend the night in one of the two privately owned houses.)The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

375,Ludlow Massacre Site,"company town,disasters,mines,ghost towns,monuments",295,985,"The Ludow, Colorado Union Massacre of 1914 is not widely discussed in the modern day, but the site of the tragic event is still largely intact allowing any visitors to the site to revisit one of the darkest days in the history of American labor. In the summer of 1913, some 8,000 Colorado mineworkers under the employ of the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company, which was mainly owned and controlled by the Rockefeller family of Standard Oil fame, banded together to form a union and went on strike to protest unfit living and working conditions. In response to the union action, the company drove the miners from their company town, but they pushed back by setting up in a ramshackle tent city right near the mines themselves, refusing to stand down. Private agency thugs and company-sponsored National Guardsmen ran regular raids on the camps, generally terrorizing the miners, but it was not until April of 1914 that things came to a bloody head.On April 20th, with tensions as high as ever, some of the militia members began firing into the camp, and the miners returned fire. The fighting lasted all day, and once the sun went down, a group of National Guardsmen put the camp to the torch, burning it to the ground.In the end somewhere in the region of 25 people were killed in the fighting and ensuing firestorm. Most horribly, a group of 11 children and 2 women who were hiding in an underground cellar were asphyxiated. The tragic events would signal a violent turning point in US labor relations, at the cost of many lives.Today, the old company town of Ludlow still stands as a ghost town, and the site of the tent city is also kept reserved, now under the care of the United Mine Workers of America. A monument to the deceased was also built by the union at the site. In addition, the cellar where so many innocents perished is still in place. The doorway can still be seen and the dark depths of the pit can still be viewed. ",The scene of one of the darkest moments in American labor history has been left essentially untouched since the tragedy. ,"Art Cartopia Museum,Raton Iridium Layer,Steam Engine 638","Trinidad, Colorado, 81082 United States 37.3392, -104.5839Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyArt Cartopia Museum11.21 milesSteam Engine 63812.49 milesRaton Iridium Layer30.96 miles",37.3392,-104.5839,steedjbasabrybengtgarycascioWhiskeyBristlescoloradorobynwwanderingsoulasabrymmattsbaggerchrismcmillonbreaingramCollector of ExperiencesTThewanderingmeatballccoloradorobynWhiskeyBristlesgarycasciobbengt,2014-12-09 00:00:00,"Art Cartopia Museum,Steam Engine 638,Raton Iridium Layer,Shrine of the Stations of the Cross","'Monument of the Third Angel',Eckley Miners' Village,Hiroshima's Hypocenter,La Siberia",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ludlow-massacre-site
376,Colonel Sanders' Grave ,"graves,gravestones,restaurants,cemeteries",680,986,"Located in Kentucky’s Cave Hill Cemetery, the grave of Colonel Harland Sanders, one of the most recognizable mascots in the entire world, honors the chicken man with a bust sculpted by his very own daughter. After working as a streetcar conductor, fireman, insurance salesman, and filling station operator, Harland Sanders was nearly destitute and living off a government pension when he finally decided to become a restaurateur at 62. After devising the concept of franchise restaurants, Sanders opened a small restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah that would serve his “secret recipe” fried chicken that he had developed during his time serving it to travelers who passed through his filling stations. With his signature black glasses, slick white goatee, and long bow tie, the elderly entrepreneur soon became the face of his new business as he traveled the country selling his recipe to eateries like a door-to-door salesman.His franchise plan exploded thanks to his aggressive sales strategy and grandfatherly charm. Within years, his Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were in every state across the country, and Sanders became a household name. By the time of his death from leukemia in 1980 at the age of 90, KFC was one of the most famous brands in the world, with over 6,000 franchises in 48 countries.The Colonel was buried in Kentucky as one of its favorite sons. His grave was marked by a bust that was created by his daughter Margaret. He was dressed in his iconic white suit and string bow tie, looking like his marketing representation even in death.     ",The grave of the iconic Kentucky Fried Chicken mascot features a bust of the man behind the goatee. ,"The Grave of Harry L.

377,Cheesman Park,"aletrail,memento mori,intriguing environs,catacombs and crypts,ecosystems",1540,985,"Designed by architects Willis A. Marean and Albert Julius Norton in 1910, the 80 beautifully landscaped acres that make up Cheesman Park in central Denver has long been considered one of the most haunted sites in America. Haunted or not, the park’s ghoulish past makes it a prime location for those interested in finding a good ghost story.In 1858, 320 acres in the new and expanding city of Denver were set aside to be used as a cemetery. Named “Mount Prospect,” the cemetery was designed to hold the bodies of the rich and wealthy on one side, those of beggers and criminals on the other side, and be filled in between with the bodies of everyone else. When the lower side of the cemetery filled more quickly—with victims of brutal crimes and accidents—residents in the area dropped the “Mount Prospect” name and started referring to the cemetery as “Old Boneyard.”With time, the cemetery fell into serious disrepair. Cattle grazed among fallen tombstones, maintained by neither the owner of the site nor the families of those who were buried there.When the city took control of the cemetery in the 1890s, it ordered all bodies removed so that the area could be cleaned up and repurposed. The lowest bidder was awarded a contract to remove the more than 5,000 dead bodies that had gone forgotten and unclaimed. Because the contract only required that 3.5-foot-long boxes be used to transport the bodies, reporters and curiosity-seekers came to watch as workers chopped up the dead who had not decayed sufficiently and shoveled them into the new crates.It was around this time that residents of the area began to report seeing spectral manifestations in their homes and out in the cemetery. Confused spirits, they said, were knocking on their doors and windows. Low moaning sounds were reported to be coming from the field of open graves.With front-page stories of the atrocities occurring at the park running in several local newspapers—”The Work of Ghouls!” ran across the top of the Denver Republican on March 19, 1893—City Hall stopped the removal of bodies pending an investigation. Over time, the holes were filled, and the rest of the bodies were forgotten. To this day, it is estimated that there are as many as 2,000-3,000 bodies still buried under the park.",A downtown park built on top of unclaimed graves. ,"Mile-High Steps at the Colorado State Capitol,The Learned Lemur ,'Unsinkable' Molly Brown House","Cheesman Park Denver, Colorado, 80206 United States",39.7321,-104.9666,Nicholas Jacksonemholmes37hanawytheCollector of ExperiencesAty Trocious,2010-08-04 00:00:00,"The Learned Lemur ,'Unsinkable' Molly Brown House,Mile-High Steps at the Colorado State Capitol,History Colorado Center","Younger's Bend,Bohemian National Cemetery,Vorstengraf,The Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cheesman-park
378,Alnwick Poison Garden,"botanical tunnels,poison,horticulture,gardens,plants",466,2817,"Inspired by the legendary botanical gardens in Padua, an English duchess created this garden dedicated entirely to flora which are deadly and/or narcotic.Behind big black gates, the carefully curated garden contains about 100 legendary killers like Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), Strychnos nux-vomica (strychnine), and Conium maculatum (hemlock). Guides explain their deadly properties while keeping ne’er-do-wells and curious children away from the plants, warning them: “Do not touch any of the plants, don’t even smell them. There are plants here that can kill you.”The duchess herself is an unlikely patron. Until 1995, she was just Jane Percy, mother of four. Then in 1995, her husband unexpectedly became the twelfth Duke of Northumberland following his brother’s untimely death, and the next thing they knew they had a castle to deal with. As she inspected her newly inherited digs and expansive gardens, much of which had been meticulously designed by the famous landscape designer Capability Brown, she came across an overgrown, neglected section. Formal gardens had been planted in that spot by the first duke in 1750, and it passed through several incarnations until World War II, when it was converted from a place of Italian ornamental splendor into a victory garden of vegetables. By 1950, it had closed. She decided to restore it, not to its former glory, but into a new, modern garden.The poison garden opened in 2005 as just a portion of the ambitious 14-acre new gardens. Wanting in part to hark back to old apothecary’s gardens, the duchess shied away from planting healing medicinals and instead sought out hard-to-get deadly poisons. Also included in the gardens are narcotic plants like opium poppies, cannabis, magic mushrooms, datura, and tobacco. Many of these required special government permission to grow. Because the danger posed by poisonous plants is very real (some can kill or sicken just through touch), some plants are caged, and the garden is secured each evening behind gates under a 24-hour security watch.Other parts of the garden include an enormous multi-level treehouse and a bamboo labyrinth. You may also find the looming Alnwick Castle strangely familiar, having seen it stand in as Hogwarts in the first two Harry Potter films.The gardens are planned in several phases, some of which are still incomplete—funds in the millions of pounds have not been as forthcoming lately.","The sign at the garden gate reads: ""These Plants Can Kill."" ","The RMS Olympic Dining Room,Barter Books,The Treehouse Restaurant at Alnwick Gardens","Denwick Lane Alnwick, England, NE66 United Kingdom",55.4114,-1.6998,Annetta BlackcarlowytheHelen Rosereley250As she is spokeHHelen RoseMonsieur Mictlanccarloreley250rrhumphrey17RachelmmbisonAAs she is spokewythe,2012-06-26 00:00:00,"Barter Books,The Treehouse Restaurant at Alnwick Gardens,The RMS Olympic Dining Room,Alnwick Castle","Betty Head Oleander Garden Park,Lotusland,Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden,Ex-Hacienda de San Gabriel de Barrera Gardens",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/alnwick-poison-garden

Unlike caves that can take millennia to form, these tube-like lava caverns can form very quickly, over just a few weeks. As thick rivers of molten lava flow from an erupting volcano, the outside layer cools and will occasionally harden to form a tunnel. When the lava stops flowing, you’re left with a solid cylindrical tube of lava that can run for up to 30 miles.Like many tunnels left behind after volcanic eruptions, the lava tube in Hana—the largest on Maui—shows all the geologic elements of lava flows that crust over. Among the many interesting things found in a lava tube are tube slime, extreme bacteria that live on the nitrogen; lava balls, which form much like a snowball rolling down a snowy hill; and lava falls, where a flow of lava has been frozen mid-fall.You enter the Hana Lava Tube through a hole in the cave’s ceiling that was created by gas punching through the crust, and explore the cavern along an unlit path. Don’t wander off though; the tunnels often have maze-like “braided” smaller tunnels in which it can be easy to get lost.",A tunnel of hardened lava along Maui’s famous Road to Hana. ,"'Ohe'o Gulch Pools (Seven Sacred Pools),Charles Lindbergh Grave Site,Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area","205 Ulaino Rd Hana, Hawaii, 96713 United States",20.7875,-156.0275,hankchapotscottforschlerkostas1964athmbisonbeccaj2021WanderingGirlbbeccaj2021sscottforschlerkostas1964athMark LoftinWWanderingGirlbinxmmbison,2009-12-11 00:00:00,"'Ohe'o Gulch Pools (Seven Sacred Pools),Charles Lindbergh Grave Site,Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area,Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum","Coconino Lava River Cave,Caves of Monte Castillo,Akiyoshido Cave,Wine Cellars of Cricova",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hana-lava-tube
380,The Marine Building,"comic books,art deco,television,film locations,film,architecture",638,987,"The Marine Building in downtown Vancouver is one of the world’s most exquisite examples of art deco architecture. When it opened in 1930, it had the distinction of being the tallest building in the British Empire. It was designed by the firm of McCarter and Nairne to evoke in their words, “some great crag rising from the sea, clinging with sea flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green, touched with gold.”The level of detail in the building is a wonder to behold. The terra cotta exterior is inlaid with reliefs of state of the art forms of transportation from the 1920s: zeppelins, steamships biplanes, and trains. The giant brass doors pick up the marine theme with intricately carved seaweed, turtles, crabs, and seahorses. The doors open onto a dazzling lobby, where the wall sconces take the form of plaster ships riding the crests of waves carved into the lobby walls. In the building’s heyday, the five elevators were operated by beautiful women in sailor suits who would escort passengers in what were the fastest elevators in the city. The lobby also contains antique telephone booths with functioning telephones.Where once the iconic building dominated downtown Vancouver, today it is dwarfed and somewhat lost amidst the newer skyscrapers. But visitors to the Marine Building will be as awestruck by its beauty as they would have been when it opened its opulent doors over eighty years ago.The beauty of the Marine Building has not been lost on Hollywood either with the ornate edifice having been featured in a number of movies and television projects. Most notably, the building has stood in for some of the most famous locations from superhero comic books such as the Baxter Building in two Fantastic Four films and Clark Kent’s workplace, The Daily Planet, in TV’s Smallville. ",This art deco masterpiece has stood in for some of the most famous buildings in comic book history. ,"Gastown Steam Clock,Digital Orca,Woodward's Spiral Staircase to Nowhere","355 Burrard Street Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C Canada",49.2876,-123.1163,Luke J SpencerJackfmwarsuewilsonleannelevingemerillupinJFish,2013-10-03 00:00:00,"Digital Orca,Gastown Steam Clock,Woodward's Spiral Staircase to Nowhere,'Abbott & Cordova, 7 August 1971'","Castell de Santa Florentina,Hatley Castle,Torrance High School,Industrial National Bank Building",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-marine-building-vancouver-british-columbia
381,Dooky Chase's Restaurant,"civil rights,black history,restaurants,history",336,987,"In 1941, Black workers in New Orleans had few places they could go to cash their checks. Other businesses—such as Dooky Chase’s Restaurant—stepped in to cash their customers’ weekly wages. Every Friday, men lined up at Edgar (“Dooky”) and Emily Chase’s eatery, paychecks in hand, and ordered themselves a drink while waiting for one of their po’ boys. The occasion was said to be a “rip-roaring good time.”The Chases’ business began in 1939 as a sandwich shop. Two years later, the couple moved the operation to Orleans Avenue. When their son, Edgar (also “Dooky”) Chase Jr., took over the restaurant with his wife, Leah, in the 1950s, they transformed the space into an upscale celebration of local cuisine and artwork. Leah had waitressed in the city’s French Quarter, learning the nuances of fine dining and noticing the cluster of expensive, whites-only eateries. Dooky Chase’s became one of the few formal establishments that welcomed Black people. Throughout the 1950s and ’60s, most interracial assembly was forbidden by the city of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana, but the Chases invited guests and activists of all races. The faces gracing their dining room are a testament to its role in the civil rights movement. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and the Freedom Bus Riders met at Dooky’s in secret. New Orleans progressives organized there regardless of race, from local lunch counter protestors to the brains behind the 1955 Godchaux sugar refinery strike.Leah became known as the “Queen of Creole Cuisine,” dishing up New Orleans classics such as Chicken Creole, gumbo, Shrimp Clemenceau, and specialties such as gumbo z’herbes, served in honor of Holy Thursday. The city’s Black artists also venerated Leah for providing the first public place in which they could display their work. Museums were historically segregated, and Leah was 54 the first time she entered an art museum, but no barriers deterred her from appreciating art, or from turning the walls of her restaurant into a gallery.Dooky Chase’s survived a small bomb in 1965 as well as Hurricanes Betsy and Katrina (though the latter shut them down for two years). The restaurant fed diners ranging from presidents (Barack Obama and George W. Bush) to singers (including Nat King Cole and Ray Charles). In 2016, Dooky passed away at the age of 88. Leah followed in 2019, at 96 years old. She supervised the restaurant well into her 90s, and the establishment remains owned and operated by her family today.","Parts of the civil rights movement unfolded in this historic eatery, helmed by the ""Queen of Creole Cuisine."" ","St. Ann's Shrine and Grotto,Edgar Degas House,General Laundry Building","2301 Orleans Ave New Orleans, Louisiana, 70119 United States",29.9681,-90.0785,rachelrummel,2020-06-04 00:00:00,"General Laundry Building,St. Ann's Shrine and Grotto,Edgar Degas House,Saint Louis Cemetery No. 2","America's Black Holocaust Museum,Mitla Cafe,Evergreen Cemetery ,Site of the Woolworth Lunch Counter Sit-in",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dooky-chases-restaurant

The upstairs floor of the building housed doctor’s offices where patrons could get a prescription for “medicinal” whiskey that could then be filled and enjoyed in the lanes below.In the decades that followed, the venue saw many different uses and eventually fell into disrepair. But today, balls are rolling down those vintage lanes once again. The venue has been gorgeously restored to its Roaring Twenties aesthetic, making it the oldest operating bowling alley in Los Angeles.Highland Park Bowl continued after Prohibition’s repeal. In the 1960s it was renamed “Mr. T’s Bowl” after its new owner. Over time, the “bowl” part was more or less dropped and Mr. T’s became an iconic local dive and punk music venue. By the time it closed in 2014 much of the bowling alley’s original decor was covered up and hidden—but not lost forever.In 2015, the venue was bought by local bar owners the 1933 Group and revived in a truly beautiful example of historic preservation. The group uncovered the building’s original decor and restored or refurbished every possible detail. When it reopened the following year, the space was transformed into a wonderful homage to Jazz Age style.The group was able to retain the building’s original wooden arches and eight wooden lanes, while the original pinsetters and pins became chandeliers and lamps. Old candy and cigarette machines and vintage league banners line the walls, and the current pin machines are prominently displayed in all their steampunk glory, backdropped by a landscape mural painted in the 1930s and unearthed during the restoration.The historic venue pays its respects to its late 20th-century history, too. In addition to the classic craft cocktails and Neapolitan-style pizza, the venue includes a live music space appropriately called “Mr. T’s.”",L.A.'s oldest operating bowling alley is a beautifully restored homage to its speakeasy days. ,"Galco's Soda Pop Stop,Chicken Boy,The Pasadena Veloway","5621 N Figueroa St Los Angeles, California, 90042 United States",34.1096,-118.1937,MegicatsstaciPurlioAvoiding Regret,2019-02-01 00:00:00,"Chicken Boy,The Pasadena Veloway,Galco's Soda Pop Stop,Cawston Ostrich Farm ","Sultana Bar,Heritage Square Museum,Anti-Saloon League Museum,The Dunham Tavern",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/highland-park-bowl

The real Macbeth was King of Scots from 1040, when he killed the ruling king for the throne, until 1057, when he himself was killed. According to ancient reports, the king was buried on the tiny island of Iona off the western coast of Scotland, alongside many other medieval monarchs laid to rest at Iona Abbey. Iona Abbey, now a church, is one of the oldest and most important religious centers of western Europe, considered a sacred site. Established by Saint Columba in 563 AD, it quickly became one of the centers that perpetuated the spread of Christianity through Scotland. Indeed, King Macbeth (“Mac Bethad mac Findlaích” in Gaelic) was known for helping to spread the Christian faith throughout Europe.Today, more than a thousand years later, abbey is one of the most well-preserved Ecclesiastical buildings survived from the Middle Ages on the Scottish Isles. Its ancient burial ground, St. Orin’s Chapel Cemetery (“Rèilig Odhrain” in Gaelic), is the final resting place of centuries of monarchs from Scotland, Norway, Ireland, France, and even some Vikings. A plaque at the chapel reads: “Built in the 1100’s, it is the oldest intact structure on Iona. Go through the decorated doorway to see the remains of an impressive tomb and a collection of elaborately-carved West Highland grave slabs.”Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure which royal graves are present at Iona. A 1549 inventory recorded 48 Scottish, 8 Norwegian and 4 Irish kings buried at St. Orin’s cemetery, Macbeth, who was nicknamed the “Red King,” among them. However, none of those graves are now identifiable, as the inscriptions have worn off long ago.By the time Shakespeare wrote Macbeth sometime in the early 1600s, the story of the Scottish king was more legend than history. But even though the real Macbeth may not have had as tragic a life as his namesake character in Shakespeare’s play, his apparent resting place certainly holds haunting beauty and majesty of epic proportions. ","A small island abbey is the final resting place of many medieval Scottish monarchs, including the real Macbeth. ","Clach Na Criche (The Wishing Stone) ,Fingal's Cave,'The Unsoiling of Rockall'","2 Sandbank Argyll and Bute, Scotland United Kingdom",56.3351,-6.3918,rayodiorneurvijabanerjiRachel PreskittJaszmina Szendrey,2016-06-07 00:00:00,"Fingal's Cave,Clach Na Criche (The Wishing Stone) ,'The Unsoiling of Rockall',World Stone Skimming Championship","Robert Louis Stevenson Museum,Île Sainte-Marguerite,Licosa Island,Isola del Garda",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iona-abbey
384,Lost City Museum,"dams,museums and collections,museums",182,983,"Situated adjacent to a Native American archaeological site, Nevada’s Lost City Museum focuses on the history of the region, most importantly the cultural artifacts that would otherwise have been lost as Lake Mead was created. Currently owned and maintained by the State of Nevada as one of its seven state museums the collection focuses on the history of the region as far back as 8000 BCE, though most specifically on the nearby Pueblo Grande de Nevada site the bulk of which was flooded under an arm of Lake Mead. The artifacts here paint a vivid picture of a culture who’s remains in part have been literally drowned by history.Originally opened as the Boulder Dam Park Museum in 1935, The Lost City Museum was built to house the finds being unearthed at the Pueblo Grande de Nevada site, an important site of Anasazi artifacts. As Lake Mead filled with water held back by the newly created Boulder (now Hoover) Dam, the deepening reservoir began to submerge archaeological sites dating into prehistory. It’s impossible to say exactly how much was lost beneath the waters of the man-made lake, but the museum saved what it could by housing both artifacts from excavations of the Pueblo Grande de Nevada site and by collecting donations of artifacts found by local ranchers on their properties. In addition to the wealth of objects displayed inside the museum, the museum’s most iconic feature is a replica Anasazi pueblo cluster built directly on the foundation of an excavated archaeological site from which many of the artifacts were collected. ",Preserving the remains of Native American cultures which otherwise would have been submerged behind Hoover Dam. ,"St. Thomas Ghost Town,Mouse's Tank,Double Negative","721 South Moapa Valley Boulevard Overton, Nevada, 89040 United States",36.5315,-114.4409,zackofalltradesWhiskeyBristlesAvoiding Regret,2015-10-21 00:00:00,"St. Thomas Ghost Town,Mouse's Tank,Double Negative,Valley of Fire","War Museum Askifou,Virginia Musical Museum,Hand of Man Museum,World Soil Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lost-city-museum

The race fans were not disappointed: massive grandstands overlooked the finely groomed track and a clubhouse offered views and fine dining, as well as the thrill of the sport. Despite the initial popularity, within a few decades the tracks had lost their initial luster, and, when the earthquake hit in 1906, the owner offered up the site to the city as a refugee camp for citizens of the burnt quarters of the city.

His two museums remain the only skeleton museums in the country. Fortunately, they’re both extensive. Skeletons: Museum of Osteology opened in Orlando in May of 2015 and features over 500 real animal skeletons. Each of these skeletons (and their complex dioramas) was cleaned and articulated by Villamette’s company, Skulls Unlimited International, which is one of the world’s leading providers of osteological specimens and one of the more exciting family-run businesses in Oklahoma, if not in the entire country.Even for experts, bone display is a long and complicated process. It can take hundreds of hours to correctly articulate a full skeleton, and even that follows months of preparation. Skulls Unlimited uses dermestid beetles to clean corpses. While the hungry beetles strip away flesh and tissue methodically and completely, it can take them six months to get through a larger animal. One can imagine how long it took the industrious insects to clean the 14-foot elephant on display in Orlando. (In addition to completed skeletons, the museum also features a small exhibit of the beetles in action.)After the beetles have had their way with a corpse, the bones are bleached in hydrogen peroxide before being assembled by Villamette’s team. For Orlando, they’ve assembled a little bit of everything: monkeys, bats, gorillas. Villamette is particularly proud of the rarer specimens here: There’s a sumatran rhinoceros and two Komodo Dragons. Recently, he told Attractions magazine that if he could acquire one more rare skeleton, he would like for it to be a giant panda. They’re nearly impossible to get ahold of, as the Chinese government keeps such close tabs on the population that even if a panda were to die in an American zoo, the remains would likely be returned.

391,Barthman's Sidewalk Clock,"aletrail,clocks,roadside attractions",438,981,"At the dawn of the 20th century it didn’t take as much effort to garner the attention of the buying public as it does today, but the core principle remains the same: novelty. The titular owner of William Barthman Jeweler had a clear grasp of this concept when he and an associate installed a working clock into the sidewalk outside their store.Barthman, along with one of his employees, Frank Homm, created the timepiece in 1896, but not as it exists today. The original clock was a mechanical jump hour clock with the numbered tablets that would flip over on the hour. It also had a little light bulb that would illuminate the clock at night. In the beginning, as passersby trampled across the clock face it was met with surprise and delight by turn-of-the-century shoppers. Unfortunately the fatal flaw of the original contraption was that it was custom designed by Barthman and Homm, and they were the only ones who knew how to fix it. Thus when the clock began to malfunction in later years, the attraction became an embarrassment, and the operators of Barthman’s store would cover it with cardboard each day to hide their shame.Unable to make the clock work with Homm’s special touch (Homm passed away in 1917), the only solution they could come up with was to replace the clock entirely. The new clock was a more traditional analog dial, ringed with a classy brass compass rose. With the installation of the new clock, and the lucky popularity of a photographer’s snapshot of the clock, the sidewalk novelty that had vexed them for years had once again become a popular feature for Barthman’s. The sidewalk clock still sits outside of Barthman’s on the corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan, just as it has for a century. It is estimated that over 50,000 people walk over the timepiece each day, not once stopping to ask the time.  Update January 2019: Barthman’s Manhattan location is relocating but the clock remains and is now visible again.Update April 2021: Barthman’s Manhattan location has relocated to 20 Broad St, but the clock is still in it’s original location.",A clock set into the concrete outside a Manhattan jeweler has been telling time underfoot for over a century. ,"New York Federal Gold Vault,The Double Check Businessman,The John Street Methodist Church","176 Broadway New York, New York United States",40.7098,-74.0095,EricGrundhausercait7911reunionswamphenedmaldonado629Helen RosescottakantorHHelen Roseeedmaldonado629ccait7911rreunionswampheneepfromersscottakantorMMAGNETsSEANETTAhana,2014-11-20 00:00:00,"The John Street Methodist Church,The Double Check Businessman,New York Federal Gold Vault,Trinity Place Bank Vault Bar","Gebr.

The unsettling sculpture is no modern work of art; built in 1546, it is one of the oldest fountains in the city of Bern.Strangely, no one is exactly sure why it’s there. There are three main theories. The first and most unfortunate possibility is that the Kindlifresser was built as a sort of warning to the Jewish community of Bern. The Kindlifresser wears a hat that is strikingly similar to the yellow pointed Judenhut that Jews were forced to wear at that time.The second theory is that the terrifying Ogre is a depiction of Kronos, the Greek Titan. Kronos has arguably one of the most disturbing tales in Greek Mythology. Long story short, Kronos eats all his god children to keep them from taking over his throne.The final theory is that the Kindlifresser is supposed to be the older brother of Duke Berchtold, the founder of Bern. Apparently the jealousy of being overshadowed by his younger brother for so many years caused him to go mad, eventually sending him into a rage where he collected and ate the town’s children. (It would seem likely that this event would have been recorded in the town’s history books, which it is not.)It may of course be none of the above, and is simply a sort of boogie man from Switzerland’s Fastnacht, or ”Night of Fasting” festival, a way to remind the children of Bern to behave. Whatever the Kindlifresser represents, it has terrified Swiss children for nearly 500 years, and hopefully, will be there to terrify them for 500 years more.","A nearly 500-year-old sculpture depicts a man eating a sack of babies, and no one is sure why. ","Klingende Sammlung,Méret Oppenheim Fountain,Einsteinhaus ","11 Kornhausplaz Bern, 3011 Switzerland",46.9485,7.4475,rc6750wythebodeane90endelCarismarkusbbodeane90lljbrownsswtraverler15mxhurley01breaingramCarismarkushhobbytfeetsMMartinSarahAllenrc6750eendelDDrDivewythe,2014-10-30 00:00:00,"Klingende Sammlung,Einsteinhaus ,Méret Oppenheim Fountain,Naturhistorisches Museum","Woman's Christian Temperance Union Fountain,Temperance Fountain,Monument to the Defenders of the Polish Post Office,Doc Ricketts Memorial",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/child-eater-bern

The thin castle stands 56 feet tall, made of cobblestones and large rocks it contains a number of empty rooms and seems to have always been more decorative than utilitarian. While Bancroft was a Worcester native, the medieval monument was a strange choice for the Naval man, and it has been speculated that Salisbury III was simply trying to use up the family fortune.No matter the intent, Bancroft Tower still stands today although the interior is gated off.

395,Dun Aonghasa,"prehistoric,forts,ruins",344,980,"Inishmore’s stunning karst landscape is made all the more ethereal thanks to the ruins of an Iron Age fort perched on a seaside cliff. Known as Dún Aonghasa, archaeologists have long studied the sprawling fort’s remnants, located 100 meters above the crashing waves of the North Atlantic, and for just as long they have come up with little distinct evidence pointing to when, precisely, the structure was created.All sorts of magnificent stories have been handed down over the years of explorers, researchers, or artists’ first reactions to Dún Aonghasa. Perhaps the most charming of all is that of noted antiquarian John O’Donovan who, upon reaching the magical fort in 1839, was so overcome with emotion that he, “shouted with delight, and after launching his umbrella a marvelous height into the air, threw himself on the ground, and shouted again and again.”Over the years, teams of specialists have surmised that the fort’s first, most basic iteration likely appeared around 1100 BCE when the earliest settlers amassed large amounts of debris against the site’s large boulders. Over the course of centuries, the fort slowly grew into today’s recognizable D-shape formation, featuring concentric walls of defenses stretching as far as the eye can see, as well as a field of upright rocks planted as a systematic deterrent (known as a “cheval de frise”).Working together, teams of specialists have restored the fort in several spots to what is thought to closely resemble its original appearance, including a six-meter-tall battlement. The restored areas are easily discernible from the rest of the archeological site due to their mortared construction. Just around the proverbial corner from Dún Aonghasa is an unrelated Neolithic tomb, along with a thatched cottage and a reconstructed poteen distillery depicting the ancient cultural heritage of the area’s first inhabitants, whose traces can be still be found in modern-day Ireland. Everything – both new and old – is open to exploration. Equally of benefit to curious minds and the site as it is a detriment to daydreamers is the fact that very few safety precautions have been added to Dún Aonghasa, meaning visitors can walk or fall right off the aforementioned cliff, if lost in thought, or simply clumsy.","An Iron Age fort on the edge of a seaside cliff offers a glimpse into an ancient, mystical world. ","Seven Churches,The Island of Inishmaan,Teampall Bheanáin","Galway Ireland 53.1258, -9.7681Book a hotel on Kayak Visit Website NearbySeven Churches2.02 milesTeampall Bheanáin4.53 milesThe Island of Inishmaan8.02 miles",53.1258,-9.7681,linzy383littlebrumbleflamideyshaw95noerml4,2016-04-01 00:00:00,"Seven Churches,Teampall Bheanáin,The Island of Inishmaan,The Dry Stone Walls of the Aran Islands","Fort Bowie National Historic Site,Ta' Hagrat Temples,Fort Churchill,Fort George",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dun-aonghasa

399,Museum of the Holy Souls in Purgatory,relics and reliquaries,210,978,"Located in the back of the Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio on the banks of the Tiber, the tiny century-old Piccolo Museo Del Purgatorio, or “Museum of the Holy Souls in Purgatory,” holds a collection of bibles, prayer books, tabletops, and articles of clothing said to have been singed by the hands of souls in purgatory.According to Catholic belief, the soul is stranded in purgatory until it atones for its sins, but can hasten its ascent to heaven through the prayers of loved ones still on earth. The scorched handprints and other burn-marks collected in this museum are believed to be the product of souls begging their earth-bound loved ones to pray harder.Though not mentioned in the Bible, the idea of purgatory is a very old part of the Catholic faith, dating back to at least the 11th century. The notion that trapped souls might need to be freed comes from a story allegedly told to the Abbott Odilo of Cluny by a monk returning from the Holy Land. He told the Abbott how his ship had been wrecked, and he had been cast ashore on a mysterious island. A hermit who lived on the island related his own story of a mysterious chasm, from which burst forth demonic flames and the agonized screams of trapped souls. He pointed out that the demons were always complaining about losing souls when the living prayed or gave alms to the poor on their behalf.The freeing of these trapped souls became a priority for the Church, and for family members grieving dead loved ones. November 2 was established as All Soul’s Day, whereon it was believed that prayers by the living could intercede on behalf of the faithful dead who had died without absolution, or babies who had died before baptism, thus freeing them for Heaven. (According to Catholic doctrine, one cannot go to hell from purgatory.)Victor Jouet, the collector and French missionary, was supposedly inspired to build this purgatorial museum after a fire destroyed a portion of the original Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio, leaving behind the scorched image of a face that he believed to be a trapped soul.The museum’s small collection of objects is contained in a single glass case.",A collection of objects supposedly singed by the hands of souls in purgatory. ,"'Res Gestae Divi Augusti' ('The Deeds of the Divine Augustus'),Porto di Ripetta,Ospedale delle Bambole (Doll Hospital)","Lungotevere Prati 12 Rome, 00193 Italy",41.9039,12.4725,JoshmbisonwytheSteve in CLEAnnetta Black,2009-10-30 00:00:00,"Porto di Ripetta,Ospedale delle Bambole (Doll Hospital),'Res Gestae Divi Augusti' ('The Deeds of the Divine Augustus'),The Flying Donkey","Hand of St. Etheldreda,Reliquary of St. Margaret of Scotland,St. Cuthbert's Cave,Basilica di Sant'Andrea",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-holy-souls-purgatory

401,Gullfoss (Golden Falls),"waterfalls,rivers,natural wonders,water,nature",2192,977,"The Hvítá river is formed by the meltwater from the Lángjökull glacier pouring out of Hvítávatn lake to begin its journey to the sea. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) downstream the wide, rushing river suddenly turns and tumbles into a deep, narrow crevice set at an oblique angle to the original course, forming a truly spectacular waterfall in the process.Gullfoss translates as “Golden Falls,” and was so named because the high sediment content of glacial water makes it glow gold in the sunlight as it roars over the cataract. Gullfoss consists of three separate drops: a relatively gentle three-step staircase that begins the descent; and a two-stage waterfall with plunges of 11 meters (36 feet) and 21 meters (69 feet). The river then continues to flow south through a deep and narrow canyon with walls up to 70 meters (230 feet) high.In the 20th century, Gullfoss was considered for hydroelectric development; although the property was leased by different interested parties, an actual project failed to materialize. There is a frequently-told story that attributes the unspoiled state of the site to Sigríður Tómasdóttir, the daughter of the leasor who worked tirelessly to block development and even threatened to jump to her death in the falls if a dam was built. This story does not seem to be true, but its popularity is such that a plaque overlooking the cascade honors her memory.Today, Gullfoss is under the protection of the state, which maintains the falls in their natural state. This has proven to be a fairly successful arrangement, as Gullfoss is arguably Iceland’s most popular waterfall, and undoubtedly one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country.","If a glacial river suddenly diving into a sheer chasm via a dramatic, multi-stage waterfall isn't peak Iceland, it's certainly close. ","Geysir Glíma Restaurant,Haukadalur Geothermal Field,The Stone Carvings of Páll Guðmundsson","Biskupstungnabraut (Route 35) Iceland 64.3270, -20.1200Visit Website NearbyGeysir Glíma Restaurant5.50 milesHaukadalur Geothermal Field5.58 milesThe Stone Carvings of Páll Guðmundsson10.94 miles",64.327,-20.12,RHyzerTimWhBearded ZombiethegenxjourneyJohan SWEKara DavisTTimWhDanHoroTravelMemoriesJohan SWEjjeffrobertsonwmtmathewbrowneLuka EsenkoKara DavisDixontripscararomanodesignshaley strongretrofuturisticaaribrownBearded ZombieannacostarowanppajamooseDr Alan P NewmanthegenxjourneyJaszmina Szendrey,2016-12-28 00:00:00,"Geysir Glíma Restaurant,Haukadalur Geothermal Field,The Stone Carvings of Páll Guðmundsson,Friðheimar","Blue Moon Valley,Sculptured Rocks,Snake Canyon,Sahalie Falls",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gullfoss-golden-falls
402,Hoover-Mason Trestle,"railroads,industrial,parks",559,977,"At its height, Bethlehem Steel was the second-largest steel producer in the United States. Employing tens of thousands of people, the company’s massive steel works on the banks of the Lehigh River supplied the building materials for projects like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Chrysler Building, the Hoover Dam, and countless others. And the backbone of this operation was the Hoover-Mason Trestle.Completed in 1907 and named after the New York engineering firm that designed it, the Hoover-Mason Trestle was a narrow gauge internal railway that shuttled raw materials from Bethlehem Steel’s ore yards to enormous blast furnaces. Every day, train cars traversed the one-half-mile-long track, delivering iron ore, limestone, and coke into the fiery maw of the industrial giant that converted them into world-famous, high-quality steel.The steel works dominated the economic, social, and physical landscape of the titular town for well over a century. Thus, when plant operations ceased in 1995, and Bethlehem Steel declared bankruptcy in 2001 and subsequently ceased to exist in 2003, the city of Bethlehem was confronted with the question of what to do with the now-silent leviathan of a facility.Rather than demolish it or leave it to fall to ruin, Bethlehem has chosen to preserve the American industrial landmark and repurpose it as a site for arts and culture. As part of that effort, the Hoover-Mason Trestle has been transformed into a 1,650-foot linear park. Standing four stories above street level, the Hoover-Mason Trestle gives visitors a place to stroll and sit at the foot of the sleeping blast furnaces, with placards providing interpretation for both the hulking machinery towering overhead as well as the lives of the people who worked there.Similar to New York’s High Line—including the presence of native plantings as well as wild vegetation—the Hoover-Mason Trestle park was completed in 2015. It is easily accessible from the Levitt Pavilion, the SteelStacks Visitor Center, and the fabulous Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem.",The internal railway of one of the biggest steel plants in America has been transformed into a linear park with unique industrial views. ,"National Museum of Industrial History,Lehigh Millennium Folk Arch,Tomb of Unknown Soldier (Bethlehem)","101 Founders Way Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 18015 United States",40.614,-75.3676,Jane Weinhardt Goldbergrvjasedlc31723caitlintjoycegncck27cm8AndiGirlggncck27cm8caitlintjoycerrvjaseyyngriAndiGirldlc31723RHyzer,2016-04-14 00:00:00,"National Museum of Industrial History,Tomb of Unknown Soldier (Bethlehem),Lehigh Millennium Folk Arch,Leonardo's Horse Scale Model","Natur-Park Südgelände,Fostoria Iron Triangle Railpark,Concrete Plant Park,Pleasley Pit",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hoovermason-trestle
403,Body Farm in Pennsylvania,"strange science,repositories of knowledge,memento mori",55,979,"“Old MacDonald had a farm, ee i ee i oh. And on that farm he had a…pile of dead bodies…?” This will soon be the tune of farmer John O’Laughlin at Grace Lair Farm in Upper/Lower Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania.Mr. O’Laughlin donated a sizable piece of his 222-acre farm to the California University of Pennsylvania to be used by students and researchers as an outdoor laboratory. This anthropological research center or “body farm” will be a place where human cadavers are analyzed in order to better understand the process of human body decomposition for the sake of forensic analysis. Sadly, it will not be open to the public.This body farm will be the fifth in the country and the first in the Northeast. The others are located in Tennessee (University of Tennessee), North Carolina (Western Carolina University), and two are in Texas (Texas State University and Sam Houston State University). The smallest, at Western Carolina, can hold up to 10 bodies at a time, while the facility at Texas State University is five acres.These facilities play an integral role in developments of forensic anthropology. “Whether it’s looking at crime scenes, or putting the bodies there, we’re going to provide meaningful education to students in the field,” says Dr. John R. Cencich, director of California University’s Institute of Criminological and Forensic Sciences.The fact that this will be the first facility in the Northeast is notable because it is located in a completely different geographical region from the other four farms. Bodies decompose at different rates depending on the climate, and the more elements human cadavers are exposed to, the quicker the rate of decomposition. Therefore, the hot and humid summers, the cold and snowy winters, and the regular precipitation throughout the year in Pennsylvania offers new discoveries in the field of forensic anthropology.Plans are still being made and details are still being sorted, but Old MacDonald will soon have a new sort of farm that will keep scientists, students, and investigators well occupied.","A macabre farm reserved part of its 222-acres for dead bodies, all in the name of science. ","Donora Smog Museum and Historical Society,Space Acorn,5th Street Steps","233 Eannotti Road Dawson, Pennsylvania, 15428 United States",40.0825,-79.615,katiebaker4asinfonianRachelneroPAZ,2012-03-14 00:00:00,"Space Acorn,Donora Smog Museum and Historical Society,5th Street Steps,Fallingwater","Preserved Head of Diogo Alves,Edison's Last Breath,Center for PostNatural History,Keats-Shelley Memorial House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/body-farm-pennsylvania
404,Old North Church,"sacred spaces,architectural oddities,architecture",3118,977,"The Old North Church is a national historic landmark. Constructed in 1723, it is the oldest standing church building in Boston. Officially known as Christ Church in the City of Boston, it’s an active Episcopal Church.High-Walled Box Pews were privately sold and ornately decorated by their wealthy owners from 1723 until 1912. On April 18th, 1775, the city of Boston was under the military occupation of over 4,500 British troops under the direction of General Thomas Gage, the military governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony. The colonists were unhappy with General Gage because he had recently sent troops into the Massachusetts countryside to search for, and capture, arms and ammunitions stockpiled by colonists One particularly large stockpile was hidden 20 miles away in Concord. Gage decided to send 700 troops out to capture it.The city of Boston was only about 780 acres at the time so word traveled fast, and soon enough the Son’s of Liberty caught on and took action. They identified their two fastest riders, William Dawes and Paul Revere, and ordered them to get to Lexington by separate routes to warn John Hancock and Sam Adams.Since the city was under siege and colonists were under a strict curfew of 10:00 pm, a backup plan was devised just in case neither of the two men were able to sneak out. Revere enlisted the help of over 30 additional trusted patriots and asked them to wait across the Charles River in Charlestown to watch the steeple of The Old North Church every night. They did this until they saw signal lanterns shining from it, the number of which indicated which route the British would take.One signal lantern meant that the British were leaving by land, two meant they’d take a water route, leaving their base in the Boston Common. Revere arranged for his contacts at the Old North Church to send the signal lanterns out to the men across the river. When the men received the signals, they immediately took off for Lexington and Concord in separate directions alerting friends and family along the way.By the time the British troops arrived in Lexington and Concord, the message had spread far and wide. The colonists were armed and ready to ambush them igniting the famous “Shot Heard ‘Round the World.” The Battles of Lexington and Concord, and thus the American Revolutionary War. ",The site of Paul Revere's historic two lantern warning. ,"Bell Ringing Chamber at Old North Church,Gruchy's Angels,Site of the Bernardine Wiget Boys School","Boston, Massachusetts, 02113 United States 42.3663, -71.0543Book a hotel on Kayak Visit Website NearbyBell Ringing Chamber at Old North Church0.01 milesGruchy's Angels0.02 milesSite of the Bernardine Wiget Boys School0.04 miles",42.3663,-71.0543,crschmidtandreaantidormigmclarkhrnickmayormammothJJulius SpadajjfishmanKKimWhiteheadaandreaantidormiRREWALLSmichaelhordernccheybookwormggmclarkbbmcbride37Ivana Vianimmayormammothhrnickrrenkesslerccrschmidt,2010-08-23 00:00:00,"Bell Ringing Chamber at Old North Church,Gruchy's Angels,Site of the Bernardine Wiget Boys School,Eliot Public School","Basilica di San Frances Musical Pillars,The Little Church,Church of Agioi Pantes,Église du Bon-Pasteur",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-north-church

But if you take a step inside, you’ll realize that it’s starkly different. St. Mary’s is one of the twenty “Painted Churches” in western Texas, each built in the 19th century by Czech and German immigrants that came to the state in search of land, opportunity and religious freedom. Hoping to preserve their cultural identity, the immigrants built churches in their new communities, intricately decorated in the style of their homelands.To make the simple wooden structures feel more like the ancient Gothic churches back home, they painted bright, colorful, and intricate patterns all over the walls, ceiling, and altars. The details were hand-painted using stenciling, marbling and other decorative painting techniques, and many of the inscriptions are written in German and Czech. These houses of worship held immense meaning to the settlers, which is evident in the countless hours of time put into making them so incredibly beautiful. St. Mary’s is considered the most majestic of the churches, dubbed the “Queen of the Painted Churches.” It has color exploding at every corner, from the vibrant German-style stained glass to the delicate artistry of the bright murals and ornate designs painted on the wooden walls. St. Mary’s is located in High Hill, Texas, once a thriving German and Czech community. The immigrants often named their new towns after the ones they left back home.

The original building was a simple domed tower construction with a powerful telescope that took advantage of the relatively undeveloped Cleveland sky that was at the time, much more free of light pollution. The site continued to develop down the decades, growing with more buildings and facilities, but unfortunately by 1950 the growth of the nearby city was shining too much ambient light into the night sky and the telescope had to be moved into a new location in Arizona. The Taylor Road facility continued to conduct astronomical research into the 1970s but the site was completely abandoned in 1982.Vines and decay accumulated on the walls as time and neglect took their toll on the observatory, however it was finally repurchased in 2005 by real estate mogul Nayyir Al Mahdi who planned on turning the site into a luxury home.

407,Chloride Ghost Town,"wild west,paintings,ghost towns,murals,sculptures,art",283,976,"Located just a short drive from the deteriorating town of Santa Claus, Chloride seems to resemble any kitschy Wild West village turned tourist trap. But if you look a little deeper, you’ll find something that makes this ghost town stand out: a wonderfully bizarre collection of junk art and a display of giant murals.In science, chloride is an ion used to desalinate seawater into drinking water. Which is ironic, because the Arizona town of the same name is incredibly dry. Founded in 1862 as a silver mining town, Chloride was once home to some 75 mines and 5,000 residents. The local miners excavated minerals like silver, gold, and turquoise for over six decades, until in the late 1920s when the town was burnt to the ground in its (near) entirety. By the 1940s, it had practically become a ghost town. Now Chloride is making a comeback, thanks to tourism. With new attractions like mock gunfights, Arizona’s oldest post office, and “The World’s Only All-Female Gun Fighting Troupe”, the town is a chance to walk through an original Wild West town. Yet amid all this, the two most unique characteristics of Chloride often go unnoticed.The bizarre junk art of Chloride can easily be seen along the roadside of the non-historic part of town. Drivers can admire a flamingo made of a gas tank, a tin man with a blue hat, and a junk tree with rusty items hanging from the branches. The graves in the town cemetery are even topped with old telephones. In fact, of the 20 currently-inhabited residences of Chloride, each of them features some display of junk art. One house, for example, features an elaborate bottle tree; another displays a metallic spider next to a caterpillar made of bowling balls.Harder to reach, yet equally worth the visit, are the Murals of Chloride. A 1.3-mile, 4-wheel-drive-only road past abandoned mines and ancient Native American petroglyphs will take you up the hill to the murals of Roy Purcell, who, in 1966, was a local prospector with some extra time on his hands. Not yet showing the signs of weathering, Purcell’s “The Journey” covers 2,000 square feet of cliffside granite and is dense in symbolism, featuring a yin yang, a giant red snake spanning multiple rocks, and a fertility goddess.",All of the 20 occupied houses in this mostly abandoned town feature some curious display of junk art. ,"'Giganticus Headicus',Kingman Explosion Memorial,Hackberry General Store","Chloride, Arizona United States 35.4140, -114.1986NearbyKingman Explosion Memorial16.68 miles'Giganticus Headicus'22.02 milesHackberry General Store26.93 miles",35.414,-114.1986,lewblankBabs81uuxauldarabrown3237,2016-09-01 00:00:00,"Kingman Explosion Memorial,'Giganticus Headicus',Hackberry General Store,Fish Bowl Spring","Clydeside Expressway Mural Wall,Murales del Congreso (Congress Murals),Rat's Restaurant,United Nations Ceiling",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chloride-ghost-town

A small cottage known as the Tyringham Gingerbread House is the property’s whimsical jewel.The Gingerbread House looks as though it’s been plucked directly from the pages of a storybook and plopped in the small New England town. It’s the final masterpiece of Sir Henry Hudson Kitson, an English-born sculptor known for his detailed depictions of American military heroes and generals.Kitson spent the last 25 years of his life crafting the exquisite cottage, which he achieved by transforming an old barn into his own personal studio and home (which, unfortunately, plunged him into debt).The house features stained glass windows settled beneath a steeply sloping roof. The 80-ton shingled roof that crowns the charming cottage took more than a decade to construct and was designed to mimic the thatched roofs found atop old British houses. Kitson even asked local farmers to grow rye to craft an authentic thatched roof, but this plan ultimately failed. Instead, hand-cut tiles were layered upon each other to create his desired effect. Piles of stones stacked against the front walls and a freestanding chimney add to the building’s fantasy appeal.In addition to the Gingerbread House, the Santarella Estate contains a small cluster of other fairytale buildings nestled within a lush garden bursting with both flora and fauna, with a few brooks and ponds thrown into the mix as well.

410,King Arthur's Stone,"king arthur,mythology,legends,medieval,war history,military,history",123,974,"“Mordred was indeed the boldest of men and always the first to launch an attack. He immediately drew his troops up in battle order, determined as he was either to win or to die… On the other side, Arthur, too, was marshaling his army… the lines of battle suddenly met, combat was joined, and they all strove with might and main to deal each other as many blows as possible.”This excerpt from The History of Kings of Britain by historiographer Geoffrey of Monmouth paints a picture of the mythical battle of Camlann. In the book, this battle took place near Cornwall and the river Camblam. Arthur faced off with his traitorous nephew Mordred, who had stolen Guinevere and Arthur’s rightful kingdom. Once ended, the Britons won, but it spelled the downfall of their dominion of Britain. After Arthur, the Saxons and Angles prevailed. On the site of this decisive legendary battle lies hidden a shard of truth. A stone, inscribed in both Latin and Ogham (a form of Celtic runic writing), reads (in Latin), “Latin…iic iacit filius M…Ar…” Some interpreters take it to mean, “The Stone of Latinus; here lies the Son of Ma.” Some believe “Ma” could mean “Magni Arturi,” Arthur the Great.Unintelligibility aside, the stone has been dated to the 6th century, around the time the real Arthur could have lived. Some view it as a compelling point that makes a stronger case for Arthur’s existence, which has been debated for a long time. The stone is over 9 feet tall and was first recorded by writer Richard Carew in the 17th-century, when he surveyed the region of Cornwall. Around the stone are many other fascinating medieval sites. An Arthurian Centre corrals them all, and from there you can explore the ones that pique your interest. There is the 18th-century secret garden of Lady Falmouth, the village of Melom, and the actual site of the mythical battle between Mordred and Arthur. Additionally, there is a trail that leads through Arthurian legend locations in this area, starting from Tintagel and ending at Dozmary Pool, where Arthur found Excalibur. ",A 6th-century stone lies at the site of the mythical battle waged between King Arthur and his nemesis Mordred.  ,"Delabole Slate Quarry,St. Nectan's Kieve,Rocky Valley Labyrinths","The Arthurian Centre  Slaughterbridge, Camelford Cornwall, England",50.6386,-4.6786,planannight2dawnbeckbeckybeccaDarian,2017-08-01 00:00:00,"Delabole Slate Quarry,St. Nectan's Kieve,Rocky Valley Labyrinths,The Museum of Witchcraft & Magic","Modena Archivolt,Aydon Castle,Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries,The Wool House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/king-arthurs-stone

Police coroners did not have to be medically trained and crime-scene investigation was minimal. All this would be changed, however, by an elderly Chicago socialite with a penchant for dollhouses and death.Inspired by her brother’s classmate and future chief medical examiner of Suffolk County, George Burgess Magrath, Mrs. Frances Glessner Lee dedicated her life to the advancement of the forensic sciences and is allegedly the inspiration for Jessica Fletcher of Murder, She Wrote. With Lee’s help, the Harvard Department of Legal Medicine was created in 1931, and through donations of manuscripts and money, it became the Magrath Library of Legal Medicine in 1934, an unprecedented compendium in the field of forensics.Lee’s greatest contribution, however, was her 18 perfectly proportioned dioramas (based on real-life crime scenes) which she donated to the department in the 1940s. These painstakingly crafted dioramas include functioning locks and lights and details such as overturned cups, bullet-holes, and boxes of chocolates as well as miniature corpses in a variety of macabre positions.Twice a year, Lee would hold week-long seminars where participants would scour the scenes for 90 minutes with only the aid of a flashlight and a magnifying glass, trying to deduce the details of the murders through the details of the dioramas.After Lee’s death in 1962, the models were acquired by the Maryland Medical Examiner’s office and underwent $50,000 in restorations in the 1990s.

After death, it was transported to the Natural History Museum where it was frozen while a tank large enough to accommodate the huge specimen was designed and built.The Spirit Collection at the London Natural History Museum holds about 22 million preserved zoological specimens, including the original collections of Sir Hans Sloane, an adventurous 18th-century traveler and collector, who also is known for having introduced the drinking of chocolate milk to Europe. His collection alone numbered some 80,000 items.

413,Spandauer Zitadelle (Spandau Citadel),"fortresses,ancient,architecture",467,977,"Built on a strategic island at the confluence of the Havel and Spree rivers, various fortifications have protected the town of Spandau (now a borough of Berlin) since at least 1197. The citadel’s current form, however, dates mostly from the mid-to-late-16th century, though it contains older segments such as the 13th century Juliusturm (Julius Tower), Berlin’s oldest building.The fortress was designed and built primarily by Count Rochus zu Lynar, and was completed in the year 1594, though it would go on to serve a military role for the next 360-odd years. During the Thirty Years War, it served as a base of operations for Swedish forces during King Gustav II Adolf’s intervention. The citadel would first fall to enemy troops in 1806 when it was taken over by Napoleon’s armies. During the French siege, much of the citadel was destroyed, but was rebuilt, and served as a prison for Prussian dissidents, as well as a treasury, most notably being used to store war reparations after the Franco-Prussian war.The end of its military career came in 1945 when it was stationed by Nazi soldiers during the Battle of Berlin. When it had become clear that they had lost, the Germans surrendered the citadel to Soviet soldiers, who were the last military personnel to occupy it. With the division of Berlin into four occupation zones, Spandau was handed over to the British, and the citadel handed over to civilian use.Beginning in 1950, the Spandau Citadel was the site of a building school, but in 1986, became a tourist attraction and cultural site. Now, the only cannons that one would hear from the citadel would be during a performance of The 1812 Overture during one of the many concerts that take place there. However, it may be possible to see old cannons along with other archeological finds, historical pieces, and works of art in the various museums and exhibitions that are located in the citadel.Finally, the vaulted roofs of the various fortress buildings make a perfect winter roost for the 10,000 bats what visit the citadel every year. ",A 12th-century fortress containing some of Berlin's oldest buildings. ,"Teufelsberg,Luisenfriedhof II,Artpark Tegel","64 Am Juliusturm Berlin, 13599 Germany",52.5412,13.2128,azrealumbraMolly McBride JacobsonBlindcolour,2016-03-22 00:00:00,"Teufelsberg,Luisenfriedhof II,Artpark Tegel,Berlin Radio Tower","The Hanging Church ,Bahdinan Gate,Barsalloch Fort,St. Mawes Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spandauer-zitadelle
414,The 1886 Crescent Hotel and Spa,"memento mori,intriguing environs,places to stay,hotels,ecosystems",834,973,"Perched high above the village of Eureka Springs, Arkansas, the 78-room Crescent Hotel and Spa was built in 1886 as a luxury retreat for those wishing to bathe in the healing springs of the area. Right from the start, however, tragedy seemed built into the  foundation. While under construction, an Irish stonemason identified only as “Michael” fell to his death inside the grand building.Not long after its debut, it became financially unsustainable, and was abandoned and fell into disrepair. In 1908, it was reopened as the Crescent College and Conservatory for Young Women. It was during this time that another tragic death occurred - a young woman fell (or was pushed) to her death from one of the top-story windows. The Conservatory closed in 1924, and again, the Crescent sat abandoned.Over the years, the Crescent was repurposed as a junior college, then a summer hotel once again. Never could any owner make a success of it.Then, in 1937, the Crescent was purchased by Norman Baker, who turned it into a hospital and health resort and painted everything lavender and purple. There Baker, who had no medical training and had been run out of his home state of Iowa, sold cures for cancer and other ailments.Baker, however, was much more than a harmless quack. He would only accept patients with no close family, and upon their acceptance to his sanitarium, would have them sign undated letters declaring themselves much improved and well.Baker’s “cures” ran the spectrum from untested to downright cruel. One “treatment” consisted of drilling holes in patients’ skulls and injecting a cocktail of spring water, cornsilk, carbolic acid and ground-up watermelon seeds. He frequently practiced surgery in the basement.One wing of the building was sealed off and named the “psychiatric ward.” There, patients who were crying out in pain would be sequestered away from prying eyes. Once the poor patients finally succumbed to either their illnesses or Baker’s treatments, he had them spirited away under cover of night (rumor has it he would take the bodies away through a secret tunnel to a local crematorium, but no such tunnel has been found).Meanwhile, he would send the previously signed letters to whatever family the patient had. After a while, he would then send the family a sadly worded notice that their relative had passed away, and requesting a sum of money to take care of the arrangements. Baker pocketed the money, of course.Once word began to trickle out about what was going on inside the Baker Hospital, the townsfolk reported him. After a multi-day standoff with local police and the FBI, he was finally imprisoned for fraud. Eurekans were so incensed by what had happened they broke down the doors and trashed the place, destroying records and even attempting to burn the building down.After the Baker incident, the Crescent sat ownerless and abandoned until 1946. Ten years later, the building nearly burned to the ground. In 1997, the building was purchased by Marty and Elise Roenigk, who oversaw an expensive six-year restoration and renovation of the hotel. In 2009, Marty Roenigk died in a car accident.Visitors over the years have reported witnessing strange goings-on in the halls and rooms of the Crescent. Room 218, where Michael fell to his death, is said to be the most haunted. Today, the hotel gives daily ghost tours. On the tours, guests visit the hotel’s basement, which was once used as the hospital’s morgue and still contains an old autopsy table.In 2017, a 62-year-old man named William Thomas fell to his death from a fourth-story balcony inside the Crescent Hotel. The incident was determined to be an accident.Frequent reports of paranormal sightings—most often involving doctors, nurses, and patients of the former hospital—make this one of the most haunted hotels in the United States. Recognized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of America’s Dozen Distinctive Destinations, the Crescent features 15 on-site acres of gardens and nature trails. Visitors can also enjoy the more than 100 restored Victorian restaurants, shops, and galleries in the nearby town.",This haunted hotel built on natural springs once served as a hospital for a quack doctor promising a cure for cancer. ,"Pivot Rock Park,Basin Park Hotel,Christ of the Ozarks","75 Prospect Ave. Eureka Springs, Arkansas, 72632 United States",36.4085,-93.7374,Nicholas JacksonlfhphotofabhatgalNoella Tmdfnjes2022candyhellcat6mmdfnjes2022mmommccheeseccandyhellcat6Darrell PowersmarlaynaglynnRRoseMBffabhatgalNoella Tccait7911ddrbartlettebbobrenner38lfhphotoDerekLuxerrenkesslerwythe,2010-08-05 00:00:00,"Basin Park Hotel,Christ of the Ozarks,Pivot Rock Park,Thorncrown Chapel","The Stanley Hotel,Garas Park Rest Camp,Treehouse Point,Bolivia's Witch Market",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-1886-crescent-hotel-and-spa-eureka-springs-arkansas

Multidisciplinary tech collective Two Bit Circus devises immersive experiences designed to thrill. No striped tents or exotic animals here; rather, visitors are whisked away to weird and wonderful sideshows elevated by virtual reality (VR) and immersive technologies.Whether you’re defending yourself from alien swamp monsters in VR or schmoozing with resident robot bartender Gearmo del Pouro at the bar, Two Bit Circus promises a downright carnivalesque outing in downtown Los Angeles. A daring concoction of technology, engineering, and ingenuity, this redefined entertainment center is housed within in a 37,000 square-foot multiplex so imposing it’s billed as a “micro-amusement park.” Inside, your pick of escape rooms, lounges, interactive performances, games, and food options await.

All in all, some 30 different VR experiences are offered within these colossal digs.Los Angeles-based visionaries Brent Bushnell and Eric Gradman helm the “band of mad scientists, roboticists, visual artists, and storytellers” behind Two Bit Circus. They collectively endeavor to “reinvent the way people play,” from souped-up arcade games to interactive Story Rooms that challenge participants to complete space missions and uncover ancient treasures before their allotted time is up.Bushnell and Gradman are no strangers to the entertainment sphere, having worked on a number of VR and interactive tech projects for the likes of Google and Disney as engineers at the Los Angeles-based creative technology collective, Syyn Labs. They founded Two Bit Circus in 2012 to forge ahead with their own productions.First came STEAM Carnival (STEAM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, art, and math), a techy take on the traveling circus that awed audiences of all ages with steampunk inventions and interactive games. But the pair eventually decided to establish a more permanent version of STEAM, and in September 2018, Two Bit Circus unveiled the micro-amusement park.A throwback to classic 80s games and the simpler days of circus entertainment, Two Bit Circus’ complex oozes nostalgia, but it simultaneously represents the future of communal play.

The first bridge was constructed to allow workers from the Trift hydroelectric plant to access a power plant that was built below the glacier to collect and use the run off. A few short years after the original bridge was built, the second, sturdier model was hung across the wide ravine and the site was opened to the public. Currently the bridge spans a vertigo-inducing almost 560 foot gap in the mountains, suspended over 300 feet from the valley floor. Unlike some of its more primitive inspirations, the Trift bridge is made of thick steel cables over which wooden planks have been bolted.

418,Rhinoceros of Belem Tower,"statues,architectural oddities,architecture",1922,971,"The first rhinoceros to set foot on European soil since Roman times did not last long. Surviving the 120-day sea voyage to Portugal, the rhino was a diplomatic gift from India. Arriving in 1515, the Indian rhinoceros was off-loaded near the construction site of the Tower of Belem in Lisbon.For a few months it was kept shackled and on display at king Manuel I’s Ribeira Palace, where it was used for less-than-sophisticated hijinks: The Portuguese attempted to make the rhino fight an elephant (the elephant wasn’t up for it, and walked off). Before long, Manuel grew tired of the rhino and decided to have it shipped off to Pope Leo X, whom he was buttering up for political favors. The year before, Manuel had sent Leo a hugely popular gift of a rare white elephant, which the pope kept as a pet and named Hanno. (Hanno died two years later of constipation—or rather of hair-brained “cures” for elephant constipation.)Tragically, the rhino never made it to Rome, drowning instead in a shipwreck off the coast of Northern Italy.Strangely, the short-lived rhino inspired a famous woodcut by the artist Albrecht Dürer, who never saw the animal in person. He based his illustration on secondhand descriptions and a sketch by an unknown artist. The resulting woodcut shows a magnificent beast in riveted armor. Real rhinos being in somewhat short order at the time, this fanciful interpretation of reality became known as “Dürer’s Rhinoceros” and went on to inspire dozens of paintings and sculptures across Europe.Meanwhile, the beautiful Tower of Belem was being built as the third in a series of fortifications designed to protect the natural port of Lisbon. Constructed between 1514 and 1520 of local lioz limestone, the tower is an example of the distinctive Portuguese “Manueline” style, named for King Manuel I. The style incorporates motifs inspired by the great Age of Discovery and the recent return of Vasco de Gama from explorations to the Far East. Design elements from Morocco, Venice, and India mingle with nautical symbols like rope. The entrance to the tower is marked with carvings of armillary spheres representing Manuel’s support of exploration.The turrets are decorated with carvings of exotic beasts. At the base of one of the turrets, stone carvers immortalized the rhinoceros they saw in 1515, now well worn, but notably lacking the armor of Dürer’s interpretation.The 100-foot tall tower survived the disastrous earthquake of 1755, and has been restored many times.

They are buried together in a single grave in the Catholic section of the cemetery.J.R.R. Tolkien attended Exeter College in Oxford, studying the Classics, Old English, the Germanic languages (especially Gothic), Welsh and Finnish. When World War I began, he delayed enlistment until he obtained his degree in 1915. During this time at Oxford he had begun working on his invented languages, including Quenya, which was heavily influenced by Finnish. He then enlisted as a second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers and was eventually sent to active duty on the Western Front.After only four months, he became ill with trench fever following the Battle of Somme and was sent back to England in November 1916. All but one of his close friends were killed in action; in honor of his friends as well as a reaction to his war experiences, he began to create many of the major stories that make up The Silmarillion. During recovery from his illness, he spent time with his wife, taking walks in the woods around the Hull area. Edith danced for him in the grove of hemlocks, inspiring the tale of Beren and Lúthien (he came to think of Edith as Lúthien and himself as Beren).It took many years for him to return to Oxford permanently. There, in 1937, he published his first major book, The Hobbit. Because of its immediate success, his publisher then requested further writings, resulting in a 16-year endeavor to write The Lord of the Rings, published in 1954 and achieving cult status by 1968. Tolkien was also one of the founders of The Inklings, a group of writers who met weekly at a local Oxford pub, The Eagle and Child, for beer and conversation. Members included C.S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams, Nevill Coghill, W.H. Lewis, Gervase Matthews, John Wain, and other writers. ",The names Lúthien and Beren can be found inscribed on the shared grave of the famous writer and his beloved wife and muse. ,"Godstow Abbey Ruins,Port Meadow,Sir James Murray's Post Box","447 Banbury Rd Oxford, England United Kingdom",51.7915,-1.272,chateauesquemolnararonJuliejoolz,2018-02-09 00:00:00,"Port Meadow,Godstow Abbey Ruins,Sir James Murray's Post Box,Saint Margaret's Well ","C.S.

Stephen had been battling Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and, upon recovery, stated that “the near-death experience, combined with what my wife taught me about love, and the appreciation I felt toward the most basic things we take for granted all had a profound effect on me. As an artist, I share the feelings I have with others through my art.”Not long after Huneck returned home to his wife and three dogs, he had the idea of wanting to “build a chapel, one that celebrated the spiritual bond we have with our dogs, and that would be open to dogs and people. People of any faith or belief system.” Huneck built the chapel on “Dog Mountain,” located on his mountaintop farm in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.Huneck styled it in the manner of “a small village church built in Vermont in 1820, quite fitting with its setting of rolling mountains and pasture,” according to his personal website. “The white steeple points up to the heavens, and on the top is a Lab with wings that turns in the wind and proclaims this place has a special affinity with dogs.” As you walk into the chapel, you are bathed in the light of the stained glass windows, with images of dogs pieced into them, and surrounded by dog carvings. The interior walls are covered in handwritten notes and photographs of dogs and other animals that have passed on, and the tables offer treats for canine visitors.Scattered around Dog Mountain are various dog sculptures such as a row of canine heads mounted on pillars and a small man in a business suit walking his dog. A sign outside of the chapel reads: “Welcome all creeds, all breeds. No dogmas allowed.”In January of 2010, the Dog Chapel and Huneck’s other galleries were hit hard by the economic downturn and Huneck was forced to lay off most of his employees. He passed away a week later. His wife Gwen continued to run the chapel, until she herself passed in the summer of 2013.

This route was part of the historic Moffat Road, one of the highest standard-gauge, non-cog railroads built in the United States. For two decades, the trestles provided an unnerving passage to passengers of the Denver & Salt Lake Railway, until the route was abandoned in 1928 with the opening of the 6.3-mile Moffat Tunnel.In 1955, the road was opened to automobile traffic following the removal of the train tracks in 1938. But this did nothing to alleviate the unsettling experience of crossing these high bridges. Following the collapse of a tunnel in 1990, the trestles, decaying from nearly 100 years of Colorado’s extreme weather, were closed to automobile and pedestrian traffic. Today, the trestles are not safe to cross, but can be seen by hiking or mountain biking the trail out to the site from either the east or west side of the pass.

In 2000, proprietors James Healy and Cathee Shultz moved the museum to its current location in Los Angeles, and expanded to what is now the largest collection of serial murderer artwork, photos of the Manson crime scenes, original photos from the Dahlia Murders, and other such relics of the violent, fatal and macabre.Other exhibits in the museum include the guillotined, severed head of Henri Landru, a body bag and coffin collection, full size replicas of execution devices, mortician and autopsy instruments (and pictures and video of such in use), taxidermy showcases, the Heaven’s Gate Cult recruiting video and more.If you’ve managed to read this far, then the Museum of Death just might be a must-see destination for your inner-ghoul. The museum is a self-guided tour that lasts about an hour, but, of course, you’re welcome to stay as long as you like (if you’re up to it).“I think it shocks people, but its a good shock,” said Healy. “Seeing all these artifacts of death in one place reminds people how precious life is.”Update as of February 2020: The museum is currently closed as they prepare to relocate to a new location. ",World's largest collection of serial killer artwork and other macabre exhibits. ,"Hollywood Tower Apartments,Gower Gulch,Capitol Records Building Morse Code","6031 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, California, 90028 United States",34.1017,-118.3212,GenkihanaLauren Levesquebritbarbie4technoblogicalJesseManttechnoblogicalskankabellaLauren Levesquejondi letnapddenagreenwaltTwin Cities Fancyhanabbritbarbie4CCraig BakerJesseManNicholas Jackson,2010-08-09 00:00:00,"Hollywood Tower Apartments,Capitol Records Building Morse Code,Gower Gulch,Chase Mosaic Movie Montages","Museum Tot Zover, Roman Urn Collection at SAMA,Museum of Death,National Museum of Death",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-death-los-angeles-california

But debauchery and hedonism are the lighter side of a more ominous history.The isolation of Sin City was not only the perfect place to escape and act out fantasies, it was also an ideal place to do a whole bunch of nuclear testing. Starting in 1951, the Nevada Test Site was a very busy place, and most of the iconic images and photos from what we think of as the nuclear era come from NTS. The testing spot, now called the Nevada National Security Site, is about 65 miles northwest of the sparkling streets of Las Vegas proper.While most tourists that visit the Capital of Second Chances are interested in the city’s rich gangster-soaked history of mobsters and indulgent celebrities or the unbelievable architecture of the casinos, those who take an interest in the Atomic Age are smack in the middle of the place where so much of it happened, and the National Atomic Testing Museum is the place to start.Housing over 12,000 artifacts, the sobering museum showcases not only the history of the Nevada Test Site, but tells the story of the nation’s nuclear program and its impact on Las Vegas and the surrounding communities. During the ’50s and ’60s, the population in Las Vegas doubled and then tripled with people who wanted to be close to the exciting scientific happenings and watch the mushroom clouds billow against the sunset.

About an hour into the Hudson Valley is the charmingly small town of Cold Spring. As delightfully quaint now as it was in 1917, it attracted newlyweds Edward Joel Cornish and Selina Bliss Carter Cornish. The lovers decided to move out of the city and into an estate in the woods just north of town.Cornish was the president of the National Lead Company, and furnished a grand estate consisting of a mansion, swimming pool, gardens and other outbuildings. The couple lived, loved, and entertained visitors frequently, throwing lavish parties and filling the rooms of the mansion with friends and laughter.Sadly, in May of 1938 tragedy struck when the life-long lovers died within two weeks of each other. Once a dream home, the mansion and the grounds fell into disrepair, and in 1958,  a fire destroyed most of the mansion leaving the Cornish’s grand estate in ruins.Today those ruins are overgrown and gradually have been reclaimed by the forest. They can be found by a 1.8 mile hike into the woods. Standing amidst the fallen down debris, it’s easy to imagine the motorcars pulling into the driveway, the well-to-do passengers excited for a weekend away from the city, the servants carrying monogramed suitcases into the mansion, champagne glasses tinkling on the lawn and the sounds of laughter coming from the swimming pool, where now there is only silence. ","A ruined mansion hidden in the woods of the Hudson Valley, home of a tragically doomed romance. ","Bannerman's Castle,Jed's Godzilla,Mt.

Popular belief is that he took special care to design the Crow’s Nest according to a childhood fantasy of his.In the early days of the inn, an orchestra was hired to play from the treehouse of the Crow’s Nest, entertaining guests on the ground floor below.Unfortunately, a 1959 earthquake that shook the park damaged the structural integrity of the inn, and the Crow’s Nest had to be closed to the public. While the damage was repaired, the Crow’s Nest has never fully opened back up to the public, albeit as much due to general safety concerns and codes.

428,The U.S. Pizza Museum,"chicago,pizza,museums",117,970,"When it comes to New York and Chicago, pizza is always a point of contention. With their thin-crust, Brooklyn-style slices, New Yorkers claim to have the best pies; while Chicagoans and their iconic deep dish pizzas beg to differ.Chicago, which is known by many names such as The Windy City and Second City, has now opened a kitschy pizza museum. The U.S. Pizza Museum, located at Roosevelt Collection in the South Loop, was started by pizza enthusiast Kendall Bruns who, quite frankly, puts anybody else’s love of pizza to shame. The Chicago artist, entrepreneur, and pizza-lover began a personal collection that explores how pizza was brought to this country by Italian immigrants. “As America’s favorite food, pizza provides an easy entry point to learn about history, pop culture, and the people behind the pizza,” Bruns told USA Today. “We expect the exhibits to have a nostalgic effect on viewers.”So, what exactly is on display in a pizza museum? Bruns has collected a mix of pop-culture pizza memorabilia and vintage items such as old menus or pizza boxes from around the country. What guests seem to love about the U.S. Pizza Museum experience is the intimate free tour they receive of the 3,000 sq ft space that houses the collection.While the pizza museum will serve pizza for special events, the museum (somewhat ironically) does not sell pizza on site. Rather, the staff will provide thoughtful pizza recommendations for those who are salivating with hunger after their visit. The opening of Chicago’s pizza museum is a hit amongst locals, perhaps making the city the uncontested pizza capital of the United States.

Unfortunately, the school only got to live under its new name for a few years before it was shuttered and abandoned.When the highway system was constructed in Jacksonville in the 1950s, I-95 and I-10 intersected a mere hundred feet from Annie Lytle Elementary. The school became isolated and inconvenient to get to, and the sound of traffic would drown out classes on the second floor.It closed for good in 1960 and was used as storage space for Duval County for some time before being officially condemned. A fire in 1995 caused part of the roof to cave in, and now nature has taken over the building. The school was almost demolished in 1999 and turned into condominiums, but multiple historic societies pressured the county to designate it a historic landmark. Annie Lytle Elementary received this honor in 2000, and dedicated volunteers have attempted to keep the grounds neat in the hopes that the property will someday be bought and repurposed. But nearly two decades later the school remains derelict and empty aside from the urban explorers who trespass there.As with any abandoned place, the school has its fair share of ghost stories (everything from psychotic janitors to schoolkids who perished in a boiler room explosion).

433,Schwerbelastungskörper,"nazis,ruins",278,970,"In the 1930s Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler was at the height of his power. Hitler envisioned Berlin as the capital of a new global empire, and - together with his favorite architect, Alber Speer - he embarked on a massive urban redesign project. The centerpiece of this project was to be the massive Volkshalle, a dome so immense it could have comfortably housed St. Peter’s Basilica inside it.Construction of such a gigantic structure presented numerous problems, the biggest one being that Berlin was founded on a swamp. In order to estimate the ability of its soft underlying soil to sustain the weight of their planned dome, the Nazis decided to conduct an experiment. In 1941, they built a huge concrete cylinder, 18 meters high and weighing about 12,650 metric tons. If this “Schwerbelastungskörper” (German for “heavy loading body”) sunk less then 6 centimeters, the soil would be deemed solid enough to sustain the dome. In fact, the cylinder sank over 18 centimeters in three years.Never one to let empirical evidence stand in his way, Hitler decided to disregard the results and build the enormous Volkshalle anyway. But weight wouldn’t have been the only problem with the dome. It is believed that the hall’s acoustics would have made communication within it almost impossible, and that the building would have had its own “weather,” including indoor rain. In the end, Hitler’s defeat prevented this doomed project from even being started.The enormous cylinder stood too close to several blocks of apartments to safely demolish after the war. So the Schwerbelastungskörper stood where it was.

434,Japanese Tea Garden ,"japanese gardens,botanical gardens,horticulture,gardens,plants",3230,2786,"The Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park is home to a few fantastic stories.1894 Midwinter Exposition contained approximately 1 acre of a Japanese village that contained a tea house (“ochaya” in Japanese). The tea garden proved to be so popular that after the fair closed, while the other temporary wooden buildings were being demolished, the ochaya was given a permanent home in Golden Gate Park. This is very fortunate because now it is the oldest Japanese ochaya in the United States, which still welcomes visitors to this day.Not much remains from the long-gone fair, but of the few things that do, a sizable fraction are in the Japanese Tea Gardens. The garden landscapes have changed quite a bit over the past hundred plus years, but thankfully there are several features that have not changed a bit. When the fair closed, Japanese landscape architect Makoto Hagiwara and superintendent John McLaren reached a gentleman’s agreement, allowing Mr. Hagiwara to create and maintain a permanent Japanese style garden as a gift for posterity.  He became caretaker of the property, pouring all of his personal wealth, passion, and creative talents into creating a garden of utmost perfection.  Mr. Hagiwara expanded the garden to its current size of approximately 5 acres where he and his family lived for many years until 1942 when they, along with approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, were forced to evacuate their homes and move into internment camps. Following the war the Hagiwaras were not allowed to return to their home in the park. The house and the Shinto shrine were demolished.Many of the structures and the Drum Bridge (Taiko Bashi) stand to this day with few modifications. The Drum Bridge is so called because it is shaped like half of a drum over a calm pool of water. The idea is that to behold a drum bridge over calm waters would offer a reflection of the bridge, creating a full circle and reminding the viewer of the moon. The reality is a gorgeously designed, very steep, slightly dangerous when damp, highly impractical and hugely entertaining piece of wooden architecture.One of the more interesting stories to come from the Japanese Tea Garden is the claim to have invented the Fortune Cookie. This sweet, crispy snack with hidden wisdom has a contentious history with many laying claim to its invention, but most seem to agree with its invention in San Francisco by Baron Hagiwara to accompany the tea served in the Garden. Podcaster and San Francisco historian Richard Miller in his podcast episode about the Chinese Fortune Cookie rightfully quips that “the ‘Chinese Fortune Cookie’ is as Chinese as ‘French Toast’ is French, which is to say, not at all.”  ",Relics of the 1894 Midwinter Exposition continue to delight visitors today. ,"Three Gems,Faery Door,Spreckels Temple of Music ","75 Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive San Francisco, California, 94118 United States",37.7702,-122.4702,ClaymorecrankyavocadoRachelMtnLadyshakespeareternalAnnetta Blackrrisrertccolor flowMMtnLadyLampshade1660ccrankyavocadoIn Search of the Perfect SunsetrayewingphotoknoxiumrebeccareccoddelapazannaMolly McBride Jacobsonshakespeareternalddarcon3RachelAnnetta Black,2011-07-26 00:00:00,"Faery Door,Three Gems,Spreckels Temple of Music ,Drawn Stone","Mildred E.

After letting friends hang around for nearly a decade, he formalized his hospitality and converted his home into a café. He applied for a liquor license shortly thereafter (his patrons were already practicing the BYOB model), and, according to the bar’s Facebook, “then took on the business model it follows today: Booze and beauty for cash.”The beauty that Venice Café alludes to—concentrated, vivid, and frenetic—swarms the property, both inside and out. The patio is filled with cement statues covered in tiles, and a collection of artwork created by Lockheed himself is visible through the window. Inside, mosaics and quirky assemblages blanket every visible surface. Venice achieves the kind of glow patrons expect from a barroom by blending the soft emanations of more than 20 different light fixtures in yellow, red, green, and blue. These collections are the result of decades of collection and curation, and Lockheed welcomes donations. Simply drop your gift off by the alley door and it will either be added to the gallery or disposed of.Downstairs, you’ll find an ATM (the bar is cash-only), along with a fish tank, turtles, and a continued expanse of mosaics that flows into two bathrooms and surrounds the toilets. To find them, just follow the stairs beneath the neon sign that reads “Shitters.” The Explorer’s Lounge, which occupies the upstairs level, opens on Friday and Saturday nights. Mr. Waylon Slithers—a king snake known for napping in a vacant turtle shell—greets guests from his tank behind the bar. Taxidermy and artwork dot the room. Attached to the lounge is a bathroom that goes by The Blue Hole and is filled with curios, from ceramic lions to ancient chests to monkey statues that hold toilet paper to more mosaics.Outside, the walls are covered in ashtrays, lighters, action figures, and more bric-a-brac. During the city’s warmer months, “The Garden” opens up, complete with spring foliage. There’s also a functioning “boat bar”—made from the front end of a boat. Patrons saddle up to the outside while a bartender mixes cocktails from behind the steering wheel.

The Crow Canyon Petroglyphs in particular are said to be the American Southwest’s most extensive collection of Navajo rock art from the 16th through 18th centuries. The Crow Canyon Archaeological District is a remote and relatively obscure area in the heart of Dinétah, which is the traditional and ancestral homeland of the Navajo people. The foundations for the Navajo culture were well established in the area, dating back as far as the year 1100. The Navajo lived within Dinétah until about the late 1700s, when they were forced to abandon it and move elsewhere because of pressure from the Ute people and encroaching Spanish settlers.The artwork in Crow Canyon preserves traces of the people who once called the land home. Most of the petroglyphs are clustered into “panels” carved predominantly within the canyon’s south-and-east-facing walls. Gazing upon them is like viewing a gallery full of hundreds of stylized animals, people, crops, weapons, and supernatural beings.Because the petroglyphs appear similar to Navajo ceremonial sand paintings, archaeologists believe these were likely linked to a ceremonial purpose as well. You’ll also see much older Ancestral Puebloan rock art intermingled with the Navajo petroglyphs.In addition to petroglyphs, Crow Canyon contains several Navajo pueblitos (archaeological ruins), built in the 16th and 17th centuries. They are, for the most part, less accessible than the petroglyphs.Today, the Navajo Tribe is the largest Native American tribe in the United States, with more than 250,000 members.",One of the American Southwest's most extensive collections of Navajo rock art. ,"Bisti Badlands,Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah Wilderness Study Area,Aztec Ruins National Monument","Farmington, New Mexico United States 36.5470, -107.6167Book a hotel on Kayak Visit Website NearbyAztec Ruins National Monument29.09 milesAh-Shi-Sle-Pah Wilderness Study Area31.15 milesBisti Badlands32.55 miles",36.547,-107.6167,syabekasabrygmwhisengarycascio,2018-08-01 00:00:00,"Aztec Ruins National Monument,Ah-Shi-Sle-Pah Wilderness Study Area,Bisti Badlands,Chaco Culture National Historical Park","Bear Gulch Pictographs,Newspaper Rock,Seminole Canyon,Coso Rock Art District",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crow-canyon-petroglyphs

He was proven right and the operation grew to include almost a hundred houses and a large facility for processing the ore. The mine flourished and in the 1920s it was taken over by the Ford Motor Company. The burgeoning automotive giant commandeered the entire output of the mine to power their factory in Dearborn, Michigan. Under ownership by Ford, the mine was widely updated, but in 1928, just a few years after the operation was purchased and redesigned, it was closed down, likely due to railroad regulations.The mine itself was finally sealed in 1958, but the towering remains of the long conveyor and processing facility still remain, surrounded by overgrowth. The remains of the old, brick coke ovens and railroad tracks are slowly being retaken by the foliage, looking a bit more haunted with passing year.

439,Las Pozas,"horticulture,sculpture gardens,outsider architecture,gardens,sculptures,plants,architectural oddities,art,architecture",139,966,"Located in Xilitla, a small town of about 10,000 people in the Huasteca region of southern San Luis Potosi state, Las Pozas is the creation of Edward James, an eccentric English poet and artist and patron of the Surrealist movement.Its origins date back to 1947 when James, living in semi-exile in Mexico at the time, acquired the coffee plantation near Xilitla. He began his life in the sheltered luxury of the English upper class, attending Eton and Oxford, and later becoming a great supporter and collector of Surrealist art, sponsoring both Dali and Magritte in the 1930s.His English home — Monkton House — is also a dedicated surrealist fantasy. His role as a patron of the arts put him in touch with luminaries of his time, including Dylan Thomas, Sigmund Freud, D. H. Lawrence, and Aldous Huxley. Huxley introduced James to Hollywood types, who in turn introduced him to spiritualist West Coast visionaries, who then introduced him to the wilds of Mexico. A great lover of plants and animals, he was immediately attracted to its jungles with their lush vegetation.James registered his new property in Mexico in the name of his friend and guide Plutarco Gastelum, who would later become the foreman and overseer of all construction that took place there. For the next ten years, James used Las Pozas as a home for orchids and exotic animals. After an unprecedented frost in 1962 destroyed many of his plants, James started building the extraordinary sculpture garden that sits on the site today. The design of Las Pozas was inspired both by James’ orchids and the vegetation of the Huastecan jungle, combined with architectural elements taken from the Surrealist movement he was so closely involved with.Construction on Las Pozas began in 1962, and carried on for the next 20 plus years until James’ death in 1984. Las Pozas means “the pools” in Spanish, named for the nine pools on the property created from waters that flow naturally through it. The gardens feature more than 30 structures, ranging from plant sculptures to winding staircases to nowhere, and cathedral-inspired screens — some ornately finished, others seemingly incomplete, although it is unclear if they were ever intended to be “finished.” Most of the construction was done by Plutaco Gastelum, James’ friend and co-designer, who was described in Smithsonian magazine as “part Yaqui Indian, part Spanish aristocrat and a swashbuckling former rancher, boxer, telegrapher and amateur architect.” Gastelum’s home is now the eclectic hotel known as Posada El Castillo, near Las Pozas.In the 1960s and 1970s, James dedicated more and more of his resources to his “Surrealist Xanadu,” as he referred to it, spending millions of dollars and employing hundreds of masons, artisans, and local craftsmen. By the times James died in 1984, he had built 36 Surrealist-inspired concrete sculptures spread out over more than 20 acres of a tropical jungle.Over time, Las Pozas became known to artists, writers, travelers, and photographers interested in James and Surrealism. After James died, the Gastelum family took over the running of Las Pozas.",Extraordinary sculpture garden created by an eccentric English poet. ,"Posada el Castillo,Sótano de las Golondrinas (Cave of Swallows),Leonora Carrington Museum ","1477 20 de Noviembre Xilitla, 79900 Mexico",21.3967,-98.9967,MarcserflacNicholas JacksonMonsieur MictlanPerSpektyfkostas1964athPerSpektyflinkogeckoMonsieur Mictlankostas1964athmmartymar2577jjulnyesserflacNicholas Jacksonleiris,2011-03-30 00:00:00,"Posada el Castillo,Leonora Carrington Museum ,Sótano de las Golondrinas (Cave of Swallows),""El Huracán de la Sierra"" (Hurricane of the Sierra)","Nek Chand Saini's Rock Garden,Music Box Village,ANIMA,Innisfree Garden",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/las-pozas

441,Hidden Cells of Newgate Prison,"victorian,prisons,crime,alcohol,history",141,968,"Of all the names guaranteed to chill the heart of a Londoner, none was as terrifying as Newgate Prison. Located in the original City of London not far from St. Paul’s Cathedral, Newgate incarcerated the capital’s wicked for more than 700 years until it was demolished in 1904. Today the site of the once-fearsome prison is home to the Old Bailey, London’s principal Central Criminal Court, with nothing to remind passersby of the infamous old prison other than a simple plaque on the Court wall. Located nearby, on a residential cul-de-sac Amen Court, are the remains of the Eastern Wall. Across the street, hidden in the depths of an old Victorian gin palace lie what’s rumored to be the last remnants of the old jail cells.Newgate’s construction was ordered as far back as 1188 by King Henry II. Over the centuries it held every kind of criminal, from thieves to highwaymen, to cutthroats and murderers. In 1783, Newgate grew in notoriety when London’s gallows were moved from the Tyburn Tree in the west of the city to the prison. Until May 26, 1868, it was possible for the public to watch the executions, with the best views sold for a premium. Over the centuries, the prison underwent numerous structural changes from its original cellblock within the old medieval City walls, but by the 1770s, it was said to resemble a “massive monolith of windowless brick.”Among the common criminals of London, many notable ne’er-do-wells spent time here at His or Her Majesty’s Pleasure. William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania was detained in contempt of court for allegedly refusing to remove his hat during a trial for being a Quaker, while Daniel Defoe was imprisoned for writing anti-church pamphlets in 1702. Giacomo Casanova was withheld for accused bigamy, and notorious pirate Captain Kidd was sent to the gallows from here.Across the street from such salubrious confines is the elegant Viaduct Tavern. Originally built as a drinking den for the labourers working on the nearby viaduct bridge, it was transformed into one of London’s finest gin palaces in 1869. Glittering vast mirrored murals depicting the statues of Commerce, Agriculture, Science and Fine Arts were carved onto the Holborn Viaduct. Still today, drinking patrons can see at the back of the bar, an elaborately carved booth, where the landlady would sell gin tokens to customers.But downstairs, past cellars filled with beer barrels, you’ll find what’s believed to be some of the former Newgate jail cells. Dark and damp with rusted iron bars, the cramped rooms certainly have the air of a centuries-old dungeon. It is said that there was once a tunnel that connected these cells with the main prison across Newgate Street. Whether this is true or a story passed down by locals over the year is unclear. It does seem likely though that the Viaduct had strong links with Newgate Prison, and was built on the site of an old debtor’s prison called the Giltspur Compter.There are other rumours surrounding the Viaduct Tavern, such as an opium den being installed on the floor above the pub, and a brothel in the upper floors. Perhaps the real story of the mysterious, chilling cells in the basement of the pub will never be known. Regardless, a visit to the Viaduct Tavern offers the opportunity to enjoy one of the few remaining, authentic Victorian gin palaces in London.",Remnants of cells from the most notorious London prison may lie in the basement of a rare Victorian Gin Palace. ,"St. Sepulchre's Execution Bell,The Golden Boy at Pye Corner,The First Public Drinking Fountain","The Viaduct Tavern 126, Newgate Street London, England",51.5163,-0.1018,Luke J SpencerSEANETTA,2017-01-31 00:00:00,"The First Public Drinking Fountain,St. Sepulchre's Execution Bell,The Golden Boy at Pye Corner,Christchurch Greyfriars Church Garden","Napier Prison,Z Ward ,Joliet Correctional Center,Prison in Fort Saint Angelo",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hidden-cells-of-newgate-prison
442,The Last Resort Bar,"murder,crime,crime and punishment,bars,murals,shops,memorials",299,966,"On January 9, 1991, police arrested Aileen Wuornos while she was drinking a beer at The Last Resort biker bar in Port Orange, Florida. Though she was arrested for an outstanding warrant, a decade later she would be put to death for the murder of six men.Wuornos has become a controversial figure. She was clearly a complicated, tragic figure (she grew up poor and sexually abused, claimed that the murders she committed were in self-defense as her johns attempted to rape her, and was poorly represented by an attorney who called himself “Dr. Legal”), and she was depicted this way in the 2003 film Monster. Given the rarity of female serial killers, Wuornos’ case gained widespread media attention, but she also became famous for her last words before her 2002 execution: “Yes, I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock, and I’ll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I’ll be back, I’ll be back.”Since the incident, not much has changed at The Last Resort. It’s still frequented by bikers, and features a “Japanese garden” of motorcycles dangling from an old oak. However, the decor has been altered to remember Wuornos’ last drink here. Pictures of her plaster the walls, including her mug shot. A mural on the bar’s brick wall depicts her craggy face and a list of her victims.

DeMille, Tom Mix, Will Rogers, Charlie Chaplin, and Sarah Bernhardt), all that remains of the Hot Wells Hotel and Space in San Antonio, Texas, is a pile of ruins. Today, the ruins are a popular destination for urban explorers seeking to trample around in what little remains of the once-impressive resort.The health spa that once stood at this site piped hot, sulfurous water from a well in Edwards to health-inducing baths and swimming pools. The destination became so popular that it continued to grow throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at one point comprising nearly 200 individual rooms.The sulfurous water was discovered in 1892 when the executives who ran the Southwestern Lunatic Asylum drilled outside of their building to supply water to a new facility near the San Antonio River. The 104-degree water, which smelled strongly of sulfur, was deemed unsuitable for use in the asylum, but many people believed that water of that sort held special healing powers. Entrepreneurs quickly took advantage of the well, which was spilling forth 180,000 gallons every day and the first resort was opened in 1893.Built by McClellan Shacklett, who was leasing the water from the well for $500 a year, the first resort advertised the medicinal benefits of its waters; the guests immediately started arriving in droves. And then it burned to the ground in 1894, only one year after it opened its doors. But its replacement, a world-class Victorian-style structure, was far more opulent. That hotel, too, burned to the ground, this time having survived 30 years. While it stood, though, it was incredibly popular.Built by a team of investors from the north who had secured a 25-year lease on the Asylum’s waters, the Victorian-style resort included a bath house and three large swimming pools, each measuring 90 feet in length. Forty-five private rooms featured marble partitions and solid porcelain tubs. As the years wore on, the investors continued to expand and improve their resort, adding steam heat, electric and gas lights, and individual telephones. Perhaps the most obscure part of the whole enterprise was an ostrich farm that was relocated to the resort from San Pedro Springs just so that visiting women could easily acquire feathers, an important component of ladies fashion of the day.Update, July 2017: The location is currently under redevelopment and the site is fenced off. Update, August 2019: Hot Wells Hotel and Spa is now open to the public as a preserved historic park.

These days, however, Rue Crémieux is an increasingly sought out haunt for fashion photographers, filmmakers, and people looking for something uniquely suited the color-saturated world of Instagram.In many respects, this quaint throughway between Rue de Lyon and Rue de Bercy doesn’t really feel like Paris at all and is perhaps more reminiscent of Portobello Road in London’s Notting Hill, or Burano in Venice. Amid the colorful façades, trompes l’œil paintings, and shuttered windows, are window boxes and terracotta pots filled with lush plants that add to the feeling you have somehow escaped Paris for a moment. This is a residential street, albeit a very short one, but the homes are not large. In fact, on one side of the street, the building is little more than one room in depth.An interesting fact that few visitors to Rue Crémieux probably realize is that the street is actually named after a lawyer. Jokes aside, it was renamed in 1897 in dedication to Adolphe Crémieux, who defended the human rights of the Jewish people living in France.Instagram has made Rue Crémieux so famous that residents have felt increasingly under siege from visitors who forget that the street is a residential neighborhood. In early 2019, residents tired with the noise, pointing lenses, and inconsiderate tourists asked the city of Paris to erect gates closing the street to visitors on evenings and weekends.

This type of treatment involved spending prolonged periods of time in the sun, in hopes that the exposure might help cure the patient.The theory is literally built into the facility, which is renowned for its Tudor Revival architecture. Massive terraces facing the sea wrap around the main building, so the children could try to sun themselves to health. It wasn’t long, however, before new drugs were developed that rendered this treatment obsolete. As such, the building’s role would shift several times over the next six decades before it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Over the ensuing decades, the facility would turn first into a home for the elderly, then into a traditional medical hospital, and finally into a hospital for the intellectually disabled.

The expose was written to show the appalling condition in various state schools through the country. The majority of the institutions included in the book were not named. Yet, the last chapter did name one institution: Seaside Regional Center (AKA Seaside Sanatorium). This institution was not named due to anything bad that occurred in the center but how it was an example of how state schools should be run.

Villa De Vecchi, alternately nicknamed the Red House, Ghost Mansion, and Casa Delle Streghe (The House of Witches), was built between 1854-1857 as the summer residence of Count Felix De Vecchi. Within a few short years of its completion the house witnessed an inexplicable string of tragedies that would forever cement its gothic legacy.Count Felix De Vecchi was head of the Italian National Guard and a decorated hero following Milan’s liberation from Austrian rule in 1848. A well-read and widely traveled man, the Count set out to build a dream retreat for his family with the help of architect Alessandro Sidoli.Alessandro Sidioli died a year before the villa was completed, and many would later view his death as the first ill omen. Nevertheless, the Count and his family made Villa De Vecchi their home during the spring and summer months, and by most accounts lead an idyllic—if brief—existence.Set within a 130,000-square-meter park, the great mansion boasted a blend of Baroque and Classical Eastern styles, and was outfitted with all the modern conveniences of the time including indoor heating pipes, dumbwaiters, and a large-scale pressurized fountain. The walls and ceilings were decorated with painstakingly detailed frescoes and friezes, and a larger-than-life fireplace presided over the main parlor where a grand piano stood at the ready. Extensive gardens and promenades rounded out the already picturesque surroundings, and an equally impressive staff house was built.Sometime in 1862 the Count returned home to find his wife brutally murdered and daughter missing. The Count put out a lengthy, unsuccessful search for his daughter, before committing suicide that same year.The villa was then passed on to Felix’s brother Biago, whose later renovations oversaw the removal of much of the estate’s Eastern aspects. Biago and his family continued to live on the grounds up until WWII, after which they vacated for good. The house made the rounds of owners and prospective buyers, but by the 1960’s was left permanently uninhabited.While the natural elements began their assault early on, the majority of the abandoned house’s irreversible damage has been done by humans. Graffiti covers the walls, and anything capable of being vandalized has been given its due makeover.  Bad boy occultist Aleister Crowley allegedly spent a few nights at the villa in the 1920’s, which naturally led to a rise in fan pilgrimages. Rumors of ritualistic orgies, sacrifices (both animal and human), suicides, and murders abound. The grand piano, once said to be played at night by a ghostly entity, has since been smashed to pieces, though some locals claim that music can still be heard coming from the house.Despite all natural and human efforts to bring about its demise, Villa De Vecchi persists. An avalanche in 2002 wiped out all of the nearby houses, while the villa remained untouched.","The abandoned ""Ghost Mansion"" was left to decay in the mountains of Northern Italy. ","Ca’ Milesi,Averara Skeletons,Varenna Cemetery",Provincial Street 2 Cortenova Italy,46.0032,9.3875,Emily LinstromMax Cortesi,2017-10-20 00:00:00,"Varenna Cemetery,Ca’ Milesi,Averara Skeletons,Torre della Sapienza (Tower of Wisdom)","Squat Milada,Hearthstone Castle,Georgetown Castle,Milner Field Ruins",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/villa-de-vecchi

So Johnny Diablo, the restaurant’s owner, decided to rebrand Pirates Tavern into something less conventional.Aside from serving vegan food, the club prohibits its dancers from wearing fur, feathers, leather, or wool while performing.

He even had a name in mind: Shawfieldmont. But Bancroft’s dream project only got as far as the bungalow and tower, when he ran out of money. He kept the property for 12 years, but then sold it to to Harold Ayers, a physician who converted the structure into a sanatorium. Through the 1920s, patients in the area suffering from ailments like tuberculosis who could afford to pay $20 a week reaped the benefits of the fresh air and treatments offered by the Groton Private Hospital, as Ayers named his facility. When the hospital closed down toward the end of the decade, the space segued from sanatorium to social center, where dances and other events were held by the Groton Hunt Club. The fox hunting-related festivities came to end when parts of the structure were burnt down after a firecracker accident on the Fourth of July, 1932.Now part of a hiking trail, the castle ruins offer great views and a perfect dramatic backdrop for local photographers and cosplayers. As with any ruins in New England, combined with the local legend that the hill was used for hangings in the 1600s, there are plenty of ghost stories surrounding the hill, such as sightings of figures wearing colonial garb and sporting disembodied limbs.",On top of Gibbet Hill lie the ruins of a lavish turn-of-the-century estate that never quite came to be. ,"Holy Hill of Zion,Sweetheart Memorial,Harvard Shaker Lollipop Graveyard","145 Lowell Rd Groton, Massachusetts, 01450 United States",42.6085,-71.5598,kensears37drondinoneglegg2011achesnaisghostfilmgeminiwolfggeminiwolfTheDiscoveryServiceJezebelGraceachesnaisglegg2011keithlmooreJohn Corgighostfilmdrondinone,2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Sweetheart Memorial,Holy Hill of Zion,Harvard Shaker Lollipop Graveyard,Westford Poe Marker","Dragsholm Castle,Georgetown Castle,Frangokastello Castle,Anoka State Hospital",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bancroft-castle
451,Randsburg,"gold rush,deserts,ghost towns,abandoned,museums",324,966,"Nestled in California’s Kern County and the Mojave desert lies the barely populated remains of what was once the booming gold rush town of Randsburg.When gold was discovered in 1895, Rand’s Mine quickly became a bustling village, despite the brutal heat of its location. The population grew rapidly to almost 4000 people by the turn of the century and transformed what had been just a Death Valley wish into a practically cosmopolitan location of commerce, wealth, and entertainment.The mines produced what would be roughly sixty million dollars worth of gold today and the village grew with every new vein that was discovered. The first post office opened in 1896 and was followed by an opera house, a general store, a lot of saloons and a few churches. Unfortunately, in 1897 a relatively large fire broke out and though it had inflicted minimal damage, it was an omen of things to come. Just a few months later, another fire broke out, swallowing about half the town. Before it could be rebuilt, a third fire took out most of the rest of the structures and the population vanished as quickly as it had been born.In the years since, the gold has dried up entirely and the town has been largely abandoned. The 2010 census found that 69 people still live in the area called Randsburg and the General Store is still open, supplying the minimal population with the goods that they need. Many of the structures still stand but are not maintained. The only visitors consist of off-road vehicles, campers or roving packs of motorcycles that are flying down the nearby Highway 395 unless it is Thanksgiving weekend or New Year’s Eve. On those holidays tourists flock into the town to check out the abandoned buildings, walk through the relatively new museum and have a drink in the old saloon with the skeleton crew of the population that remains.Many movies and music videos have been shot on location in Randsburg as well, due to the uniqueness of it being a mostly abandoned ghost town that still has basic amenities and plenty of local color. 2011’s blockbuster film Cowboys and Aliens featured many scenes that were filmed in the town, and the video for Dwight Yoakam’s video Long White Cadillac was filmed there too, just to name a few.",The liveliest ghost town in the state. ,"California City: The Unbuilt Suburb,Burro Schmidt Tunnel,Saltdale","Johannesburg, California, 93528 United States 35.3686, -117.6581NearbyBurro Schmidt Tunnel12.61 milesSaltdale12.84 milesCalifornia City: The Unbuilt Suburb15.14 miles",35.3686,-117.6581,Shannon OhairecarolelizabethdeweyKeri KilgoAvoiding RegretcyanidesirenMartinccreativeflutecyanidesirenKeri KilgocarolelizabethdeweyMMartinAvoiding RegretRachel,2013-11-24 00:00:00,"Burro Schmidt Tunnel,Saltdale,California City: The Unbuilt Suburb,Lake Shore Inn","Goffs Schoolhouse Museum,Okanogan Highland Ghost Towns,Buried Village of Al Madam ,Dana Village",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/randsburg-california
452,East Corinth,"film locations,intriguing environs,ecosystems",203,966,"In the 1988 comedy Beetlejuice, the Maitlands, a recently deceased couple played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, find their house “haunted” by the Deetz family who purchase it after their death. Frustrated with the bureaucratic morass that is the afterlife and their own inability to scare the family off of their property, they call a bio-exorcist, a ghost claiming to be skilled in the removal of the living. His name is Beetlejuice, a rowdy, lewd, uncontrollable scamp played by Michael Keaton.Although the film takes place in Connecticut, it was actually filmed in Vermont, in the town of East Corinth. The main street that bisects the town goes by most of the featured locations. The town’s Mason Hall stood in for Lydia Dietz’s schoolhouse, a general store stands in for a hardware store, the town library makes an appearance, and the whole town is shown in overview.The bridge where the Maitlands die still exists, but is not a covered bridge. At the time of filming, the bridge was just a handful of planks and a pair of guardrails. Now it’s a more modern concrete bridge. It can be found on Chicken Farm Road, close to where the street intersects with Village Road.The delightfully mashed-up 1980s/Victorian house where most of the movie takes place was specially constructed on-site for the film and was mostly just a façade. The hill where it was built, however, can be seen on the main road at the southern edge of the downtown area. A closer view of it can be found off of Jewell Lane, which is basically the driveway to the farm on which the hill stands. The open interior of the fake building was used as a basketball court by the film crew, and the “roof” was actually painted canvas that sagged. When filming exterior shots, the fake building was pressurized with giant fans to make the “roof” puff up to look like a real roof. The “cover” from the bridge was re-purposed, and is in use at the Northeast Slopes ski area, a few miles away on Rte 25. The general store went out of business, and the building is currently undergoing massive renovations, having been gutted to the studs, and raised several feet, so a new foundation can be poured.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W.

The Ladew gardens and estate were established in the 1930s by wealthy eccentric Harvey S. Ladew. The rich huntsman was enamored with English culture and design, especially the tradition of fox-hunting. So great was his love of the pastime that when he went to create his grand estate, he made sure that it shared a border with a hunting club.Ladew bought over 200 acres of land in 1929 and set out to turning them into the lush, elaborate topiary gardens that stand today. Again inspired by an English landscaping trend at the time, the garden was designed with 15 “rooms,” which are small areas devoted to a single color or theme such as roses, or simply, yellow. The grounds contain multiple fountains and pools, and are surrounded by shaped and trimmed hedge formations that look like something straight out of a lush castle yard.Possibly the most telling and singular piece among the opulent garden is the shaped hunt, where bushy dogs chase a topiary fox across the grounds. Ladew’s house is also open to visitors who would like to know more about the interesting man’s life and travels.",This English-inspired Maryland garden is home to acres of opulent plant life including bushes shaped into an entire fox hunt. ,"System Source Computer Museum,Beaver Dam ,Divine's Headstone","3535 Jarrettsville Pike Monkton, Maryland, 21111 United States",39.5806,-76.5133,erinjeanMike Portanovabrf2001blimpcaptainphsforlifenoellemackbblimpcaptainpphsforlifeToriaroscurohhowardfeingoldMMike Portanovabbrf2001noellemack,2015-08-06 00:00:00,"Beaver Dam ,System Source Computer Museum,Divine's Headstone,Joesting-Gorsuch House","Allan Gardens Conservatory,The Topiary Park,Biddulph Grange,Oedo Botania",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ladew-topiary-gardens
454,Echo Amphitheater,"sounds,geological oddities,geology",301,965,"Located among the sandstone cliffs of New Mexico, the Echo Amphitheater is now known for its unique echoing auditory properties, but also supposedly carries the stains of wild west killings. According to legend the curved stone cliff wall now known as Echo Amphitheater was the site where a group of Navajo executed a family of settlers. As the story goes, the victims were brought to the top of the cliff and killed, their blood running down the cliff wall and permanently staining it. Possibly in response to this legend another story says that years later a number of Navajo were in turn murdered in the same spot, once again staining the cliff wall with their draining blood. Now the natural echoing caused by the site’s geography is often ascribed to the voices of the unquiet dead. There seems to be little truth to the tales, but the colorful sandstone itself may have inspired the myths. Running in red vertical stripes down the otherwise horizontally stratified cliff wall are streaks of mineral varnish that resemble blood. This colorful geological feature combined with its unusual auditory properties no doubt fed the myth associated with the Echo Amphitheater.Regardless of the legend, the Echo Amphitheater sees a steady stream of campers coming to throw their voices off the cliff wall to listen to them bounce and fade like the voices of the long forgotten dead.  ",Natural sonic phenomenon comes with a grisly legend of murder and blood. ,"Ghost Ranch,Cerro Pedernal,Penitente Morada of Abiquiú","US-84 Abiquiu, New Mexico, 87510 United States",36.3589,-106.523,owenkatherine7216CorpseLady84nizhoniburnsidejlsnyderehowardrothhzoi,2014-02-25 00:00:00,"Ghost Ranch,Cerro Pedernal,Penitente Morada of Abiquiú,Nogales Cliff House","Ear of Dionysius,Booming Dunes of Badain Jaran Desert,Sand Mountain,The Sonorous Stones of Ringing Rocks Park",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/echo-amphitheatre

According to reports, the ship was smuggling cigarettes, booze, and maybe even humans when the authorities caught onto the trail and chased it through bad weather, right into the cove, where it ran aground. Ever since the crash, the hulk has sat on the shore slowly falling apart.The crash site soon became a popular destination for vacationers looking not only for an untouched beach but called by the siren song of the decaying ship.

While Elwood’s story is suspect, the fabricated origin is perfectly in character for the shop which seems to celebrate pranks and hucksterism.The gift shop space contains a massive Bigfoot statue that greets customers and the shelves are jam-packed with weird pop artifacts, cheap gag toys, and creepy specimens. In the Peculiarium itself, the wide variety of exhibits include a nightmare dollhouse, a lot of very odd drawings and memorabilia, and even a trip inside a zombie’s brain. Photography is encouraged and there are great places for visitors to take selfies, including a seated, evil-looking Krampus with blazing red eyes and a life-size recreation of an alien autopsy. In addition to the items for sale, the space doubles as an art gallery, spotlighting talented local Portland artists who can hang their works among the bustling kitsch ephemera.  Ironically the Freakybuttrue Peculiarium’s most squirm-inducing attraction is not its fake severed body parts.

This piece, hidden in the foliage, is probably the most difficult to spot, and thus the most sought-after. Since the statue’s installation several decades ago, the tree has grown up and around him, swallowing his shoes and part of his saw blade. Whether or not his maker eventually chooses to reveal their identity, all signs point to that the industrious woodcutter will remain hard at work. This little fellow also has been made subject of modern treasure hunters, since it is a main feature in a Geocache.Update as of November 2019: The woodcutter is no longer on his normal perch due to a strong wind, it’s unknown when the figure will be replaced. Update as of January 2022: The woodcutter is now placed in another tree at the same park right above the path towards the north.",This unattributed sculpture in Amsterdam is hiding in plain sight. ,"Pijpencabinet (Amsterdam Pipe Museum),Aletta Henrïette Jacobs,Zevenlandenhuizen (Seven Country Houses)","Vondelspark Amsterdam, 1054 Netherlands",52.3632,4.8805,aRedLetterLifenightlogic01Draghkarrenelemscmcolmanhanarrenelemsnightlogic01DDraghkarccmcolmanRHyzerbbrickhoundccontacthubihanaCoolCrabRuss Arno,2015-11-05 00:00:00,"Aletta Henrïette Jacobs,Zevenlandenhuizen (Seven Country Houses),Pijpencabinet (Amsterdam Pipe Museum),Cuypers Library","Elfin Oak,Kemptown Secret Garden,'Greetings from Jerusalem Avenue',Neskowin Ghost Forest",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-little-woodcutter-amsterdam-netherlands

Opened in 2011, the shiny ethereal building cost $70 million to build, but resulted in a chic complex of galleries accessible through a narrow entrance in the building’s front.Quite fittingly, considering the magical appearance of the museum, it was Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian novelist, author of One Hundred Years of Solitude, and founder of the magical realist literary movement,  who cut the ribbon during the opening ceremony.  Although the museum was a donation from Carlos Slim, each part of its construction was an inside job. His son in law, Fernando Romero, designed the massive structure and the exterior is covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum tiles from an aluminum plant Carlos Slim owns. The entire structure coyly enriches Mexico City’s cultural landscape while padding the pockets of the museum’s benefactor.While the modern architecture of the Soumaya Museum has drawn praise for its ingenuity and partnership with Frank Gehry, many have also derided the building as an eyesore. One critic even went as far as to attack Carlos Slim, saying that money can buy everything, except taste. Worth an estimated $65 billion, it’s at least nice to see Carlos Slim give a little back to his country. A museum is certainly a better way to spend your billions than writing your name in the sand of your private island.","66,000 pieces of art, donated by one of the world's richest men. ","Cafebrería El Péndulo,Flowers & Gardens Spring Festival ,'Asia in Ivory'","303 Blvd. Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra Mexico City, 11529 Mexico",19.4406,-99.2047,atimiannanpalmeroWas Buf Now WasMonsieur MictlanesmetravelsulisescorzalinkogeckoMonsieur MictlannanpalmerouulisescorzaaandreabcWas Buf Now Wasracheldoyleesmetravelsrjhemedes,2011-12-28 00:00:00,"'Asia in Ivory',Flowers & Gardens Spring Festival ,Cafebrería El Péndulo,Pabellón Coreano de la Amistad (Korean Friendship Pavillion)","Museo Canova,The Noguchi Museum,Milwaukee Art Museum,Pablo Fierro Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soumaya-museum

Now it is filled with more than 40 billion gallons of acidic water, heavy metals, and unique microscopic lifeforms.The Berkeley Pit is a former open-pit copper mine in Butte, Montana and now one of the only places in the world where you can pay to see toxic waste. The sheer scale of the site is something to behold. In aerial photos, it appears simply as a huge black splotch.The pit is one mile long by half a mile wide, and over 1,780 feet deep, 1,000 of which are filled with acidic water with high concentrations of heavy metals and toxic chemicals, including copper, iron, arsenic, cadmium, zinc, and sulfuric acid. The iron-rich water near the surface is reddish, yielding to a vibrant lime-green hue not far below the surface, where copper concentrations are higher. If you were to drink large amounts of this lovely concoction it would kill you by corroding through your digestive system. Interestingly enough, new fungal and bacterial species have been found to have adapted to the harsh conditions inside the Pit. Intense competition for the limited resources caused these species to evolve the production of highly toxic compounds to improve survivability, some of which have been isolated from these organisms and show selective activity against cancer cell lines. Currently, research continues.Over the active lifespan of the mine, approximately 320 million tons of ore and over 700 million tons of waste rock were mined from the Pit. In other words, it produced enough copper to pave a four-lane highway two inches thick from Chicago to New York, with enough left over to keep going to the tip of Long Island. We explored the Berkeley Pit Mine on Obscura Day - March 20th, 2010.

Cusco is every single thing that Santa Fe, New Mexico would like to be - magnificently Spanish colonial, profoundly Indian, filled with often brilliant crafts, and made entirely of real adobe. Just up the hill is the famed Sacsayhuaman complex of behemoth stones perfectly fitted together by Incan engineers. (A nice place to stay in Cusco is the Hotel Monasterio - a restored monastery now run by the Orient Express.)The train ride to Aguas Caliente is worth the trip all by itself. Surprisingly, Machu Picchu (at nearly 8,000 feet) itself is in fact lower than Cusco, and it’s northwestward, down into the Amazon jungle. As one travels along one sees the biomes change before their eyes. Along the whole way are spectacular rivers, especially the Urubamba, plunging white water without end for miles - it is so relentless and violent, that to this day it has never been kayaked. (When the train stops jump out for some hot corn on the cob offered by locals, with kernels seemingly as big as Inca stonework and purely delicious.)One is also reminded they are in the Andes. They dwarf all other mountain ranges. So godallmighty huge and steep and inviting and menacing and one marvel at the skill of the Inca and their predecessors, to imagine their mastering these mountains as they did.If we judge the Greeks and Romans highly because of the excellence of their architecture, what do we make of the Inca, who could be said to surpass them architecturally? In fact, the Inca surpasses everybody in their reverence for stone and water.At Machu Picchu sixteen stone waterfalls sequence down one side of the site. All over Machu Picchu massive crafted stones are fit together in near-perfect harmony and celebrate the sun, the year cycle, the surrounding mountain shapes, and the way humans take a step.Machu Picchu is among the greatest architectural achievements and cultural centers of the Incas and the Old World. It is so perfectly built that the structures are able to survive earthquakes, pretty common in Peru and specifically in Machu Picchu, as it was built on top of two fault lines.Since its discovery, the citadel has attracted millions of tourists, becoming the most visited attraction in Peru.

468,Ruins of the McMillan Sand Filtration Site,"water temples,public works,waterworks,preservation,technology,infrastructure,abandoned",154,962,"Typhoid epidemics regularly swept across Washington at the turn of the century as the population increased and industrial pollution worsened. A chief culprit was the city water supply. The unfiltered Washington Aqueduct carried a stream laced with bacteria and a notorious amount of Potomac mud, described by a Washington Post reporter as a “Seal-brown mixture of water and real estate.”Shortly after the new city reservoir was completed at Howard University, Congress authorized funds for an adjacent filtration site to address the public health situation. The facility relied entirely on sand to clean the water; at the time, this method scaled better and was more cost effective than using chemicals.“Raw water” came in from the reservoir next door and slowly percolated through the sand in 25 vaulted underground cells before making its way out into District taps. The 4-foot lining of sand actually did a remarkable job at removing bacteria and sediment from the water.According to a historic preservation report, the sand was brought in from Laurel, Maryland on the B&O Railroad and “went through an extensive preparation process to meet specifications for cleanliness, removing all traces of clay and other undesirable particles.”Enormous quantities of fresh sand were stored aboveground in parallel rows of stubby concrete silos. Engineers could shovel it out when necessary and drop it down into the cells through 2,100 manholes that are visible in satellite imagery.Improvements like the Washington Aqueduct and the McMillan Sand Filtration Site came to D.C. as part of the City Beautiful movement funded in large part by the Federal Government.  The site is named after Senator James McMillan and propelled by support by President William Howard Taft, Congress and the Government set out to ensure the city and officlals themselves had clean water to drink.At the time there was a different, more positive image of Washington’s water supply as a Public Work, and not merely a piece of infrastructure. As such, the nation’s foremost landscape architect was called in to devise a plan to pretty up the filtration site. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. designed a public park at the adjacent reservoir on the west side of 1st ST NW that became an important community gathering place for District residents. For a time, it was a popular destination for picnics, outdoor activities, or a quiet stroll away from the bustle of city life. Unfortunately, the park was fenced off for security reasons during World War II. It was promised to be reopened, but after African American soldiers came home and began to move into the area, Congress at that time chose not to reopen it.This park extended as open green space across several parcels including above the sand filtration site. Despite believing, “perhaps inexpedient to admit the public to use the plain even upon a fenced path,” Olmsted created a pathway that surrounded and overlooked the sand filtration site. Despite the temptations to use the open plains most people chose not to venture out among the 2,100 manholes across the 20-acres with open vistas in all directions although there are images showing defacto use as baseball fields and like-recreational activities (Records indicate that between three and four acres of manholes would be open at any given time to provide light and air to workers that were cleaning the sand in the filter beds below.)Olmsted’s plantings and perimeter pathway around the sand filtration site were designed to complement the “interesting and remarkable” appearance of the sand storage towers, the walls of which he covered in ivy. D.C. city government purchased the McMillan Sand Filtration Site after it closed in 1986, but the site was sadly neglected by city officials despite historic protection requirements. It is a fantastic opportunity for preservation and a redevelopment project similar to New York’s High Line. Today all 25 acres sit behind a chain-link fence. The 20 one-acre underground cement water cisterns are a magical mystical place despite the city’s neglect. There is a neighborhood movement to restore the underground and make it a public space, but its future is uncertain since the city has considered many other development plans for the site.",An Industrial Revolution-era public work that purified water using nothing but sand. ,"Mary's Garden,Benjamin Grenup Monument,Glenwood Cemetery's Chainsaw Sculptures","1st Street NW and Channing Street NW Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.9246,-77.0106,Elliot Cartererkiletiankevinrapp7chrisotten2Martin,2017-06-16 00:00:00,"Glenwood Cemetery's Chainsaw Sculptures,Benjamin Grenup Monument,Mary's Garden,Mary Church Terrell House","Abandoned Sea Cable Car,Schöneberg Gasometer,C&O Boat Elevator Ruins,Washington Aqueduct Emergency Pumping Station",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ruins-of-the-mcmillan-sand-filtration-site

And there’s no better place to rest and reflect on the country’s history than at the Mitsitam Cafe inside the National Museum of the American Indian.

Or, indulge in bison burgers from the Great Plains, while watching chefs cook cedar-planked juniper salmon in a built-in fire pit in the cafe’s partly-visible kitchen. Thanksgiving comes early for vegetarians, who can enjoy cranberry-infused roasted gourds, mushrooms and cornmeal, and blueberry cheesecake. The cafe’s Navajo executive chef, Freddie Bitsoie, combines his background in cultural anthropology and art history with his expertise in the culinary arts to come up with a menu that features both Native American foods and contemporary dishes made with indigenous ingredients.Many ingredients for the cafe’s dishes come from tribal food co-ops or companies. A large portion of the meat comes from the InterTribal Bison Council, a non-profit organization of 57 American Indian tribes that collectively tend to more than 15,000 bison in South Dakota. Mitsitam uses 250,000 pounds of the meat every year to make chili, burgers, and meatloaf, among other delicacies.The interior design of the cafe follows the thoughtful architecture of the museum as a whole, keeping indigenous design elements in mind. A 20-foot totem pole carved by Nathan Jackson, a Tlingit artist from Ketchikan, Alaska, forms the cafe’s centerpiece.

471,Holloways of Dorset,"botanical tunnels,wwi,forests,roads,transportation,world war ii,ancient,ecosystems,military,nature,animals,history",110,960,"Criss-crossing the bucolic county of Dorset in southern England are tunnel-like roads that have been naturally sunken by countless footsteps over centuries of repeated use.These extremely well-trodden paths are often called holloways, from the Old English word “hola weg” meaning sunken road. They are a little-known treasure of the English countryside, found in parts of the world with long histories and soft rather than rocky ground, like the chalky sandstone on the English Channel coast.Most of the ancient highways are between 300 and 3,000 years old, dating as far back as Roman times or even earlier. They would have started as drovers’ roads or pilgrims’ paths, worn down by year after year of human feet, hooves of horses and cattle, and wheels of carts heading to market. In storms the ditches would have filled with flowing water, further eroding the trench-like path until its hollowed out shape resembled more of a gorge than a road. In some places, the holloways in Dorset have receded as much as 20 feet below the land on either side. Trees rise up from the banks flanking the overgrown narrow path, sometimes reaching toward each other to form an almost storybook canopy over the road, appearing like a tunnel through the thick greenery.The recessed thoroughfares of Dorset cross from the coast heading to the north, inland toward North Chideock and Symondsbury villages in west Bridport. They were likely used to transport goods to and from the ships in the harbors. One especially deep, 300-year-old holloway is called “Hell Lane” despite its rather charming appearance in certain parts. It was nearly forgotten until it was explored and photographed by Robert Macfarlane for his book Holloway, along with other sunken lanes of Dorset. Many holloways are now abandoned as roads, too narrow to be traveled on wheels. But they are still used as walking paths by locals in the know. Others, such as the trench-like roads in parts of France, were used as shelters in World War I and II. It’s fascinating to stroll through the ancient paths today and wonder about the comings and goings of the unfathomable number of human footsteps that carved them out of the Earth. ",These ancient sunken lanes were naturally tunneled into the soft ground by countless footsteps. ,"Charmouth Beach,The Glowing Clams of Great Britain,Lyme Regis Museum","Hell Lane Dorset, England United Kingdom",50.7414,-2.8195,MeggrahamrdellcharleyspoonsMorrisD45,2017-11-13 00:00:00,"Charmouth Beach,Lyme Regis Museum,The Glowing Clams of Great Britain,Axmouth Bridge","Newhaven Fort,Portuguese Fireplace,B-23 'Dragon Bomber' Wreckage ,Fort Tarakanivskyy",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holloways-of-dorset

This is the final resting place of Presidio residents’ beloved pets.The cemetery isn’t well documented, and there are various stories describing it’s beginnings. While some attest that it began as a burial plot for K-9 guard dogs back in World War II, others believe it was a burial ground for 19th-century cavalry horses. What the accounts do agree on is that the cemetery dates back at least to the 1950s, when military families inhabited the base.Whatever the case, the Presidio Pet Cemetery is a testament to the love and affection of owners for their pets. Tiny tombstones of wood and stone dot the cemetery with inscriptions dedicated to the dogs, cats, birds, goldfish, hamsters, and lizards buried beneath. Tiny wooden plaques shaped like tombstones are stenciled with such sentiments as: “Skipper, the best damn dog we ever had. 1967” and “Loved, pet Stinky.”A massive construction project started in late 2009 to overhaul the seismic nightmare that was much of the causeway area leading up to the Golden Gate Bridge. Community advocates managed to spare the cemetery from complete destruction as the Doyle Drive freeway ramp was torn down and rebuilt.

Translating to “without water,” their name is derived from the name the Spanish Conquistadors gave the area when they arrived, shocked that people were able to survive in such an arid region.The Northern Sinagua people inhabited what is now Flagstaff, Arizona, from around 700 to 1300. Today, a large and scenic nature preserve within the city protects rare wetlands, birds and other wildlife, and the more than 150 Sinagua petroglyphs that gave Picture Canyon its name. The Sinagua people were primarily hunter-gatherers, but they did practice some limited agriculture after picking up irrigation techniques from their neighbors, the Hohokam tribe. Etched on rocks throughout the area, the petroglyphs in Picture Canyon depict scenes from this tribal life, such as hunters and animals like deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and water birds.For reasons that are not totally understood—possibly drought, resource depletion, clashes with the neighboring Yavapai people, a changing climate, or some combination of these factors—the Northern Sinagua people left the region and resettled elsewhere, possibly becoming the early ancestors of the Hopi, Zuni, or Pima peoples.For many centuries thereafter Picture Canyon was neglected and the growth of the city of Flagstaff began threatening the archaeological sites. Timber companies constructed railroads across the area in the early 20th century. The Arizona archaeologist Harold S. Colton took note of the area and studied it in 1928 but in the process unceremoniously looted the graves he uncovered there. Later, the El Paso company gas line was laid across the area and likely destroyed many historical sites in the process. The canyon also became a dumping ground by locals for cars, mattresses, and other garbage.For many years the petroglyphs and other archaeological sites in Picture Canyon were a little-known secret. As the city of Flagstaff kept growing, development encroached on the area. Citizens began advocating for the restoration and preservation of this picturesque landscape. They organized several cleanup efforts, including having cranes brought in to remove the abandoned and rusting cars. Their efforts paid off, and today the Picture Canyon Natural and Cultural Preserve includes a small network of trails looping around the canyon and the surrounding area. Observant visitors can spot the numerous petroglyphs etched by the Northern Sinagua people throughout the preserve, along with the ruins of some pithouses constructed many centuries ago, and other archaeological artifacts.",A nature and cultural preserve named for its multitude of petroglyphs carved by the Northern Sinagua people. ,"The Museum Club,Walnut Canyon,Grover the Geologic Rover","3920 N El Paso Flagstaff Rd Flagstaff, Arizona United States",35.2271,-111.5572,WhiskeyBristlesmaryflowers27gretchengooby,2019-02-04 00:00:00,"The Museum Club,Grover the Geologic Rover,Walnut Canyon,Old Two Spot Logging Train","Coso Rock Art District,Bear Gulch Pictographs,Ute Mountain Tribal Park,La Piedra Escrita",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/picture-canyon
476,Swannanoa Palace,"mansions,eccentric homes,homes,architecture",248,961,"Sitting atop a Virginia hill is what seems to be an Italianate palace plucked right from Europe and dropped down in the states, but this lovely mansion is actually an original construction, created as a token of love and devotion between a husband and wife.The estate that would come to be known as Swannanoa was first built in 1912 by railroad millionaire James H. Dooley. He purchased 1,000 acres of land to build his grand manse and styled it after the historic buildings of Rome. The tall facade features two tower-like structures attached to the front, decked out in elaborate columns and moulding. Word was that Dooley had built the ornate mansion to honor his wife, Sallie O. May and this would seem to be evident in the ten-foot Tiffany & Co. stained-glass image of her that was installed above the main stairs.In addition to the main, 52-room house, the grounds were dotted with fountains, gardens, towers, and staff housing. Once completed, it served as a Virginia summer home for the couple while they were alive. (The Dooleys’ principal residence was Maymont in Richmond, which still survives today along with its vast acreage that contains a dairy, a zoo, Japanese and other extensive gardens.)When they passed away, the house fell into disrepair for a time until it the grounds became a country club, during which time, Calvin Coolidge dined there. Later, it was leased in 1948 by Walter and Lao Russell, who were scientists, cosmologists, spiritualists, artists and, luckily, renovators who were looking for a spiritual and beautiful place. They established the University of Science and Philosophy at Swannanoa and used the house as a museum and repository for all of Walter Russell’s writings, books, art works, and scientific charts. Walter Russell died in 1963, but his much younger wife continued living there until her death in 1988. The house fell into disrepair, and became the lovely historic site it is today. Currently, the mansion and grounds are protected as a historic landmark, and are mainly used for weddings and fancy private events. The main mansion house looks as glorious as it ever did, making it the perfect place for love to bloom, just like it did when the mansion was built.",This historic mansion was built as a symbol of love between a husband and wife. ,"The Monroe Institute,Frontier Culture Museum ,Crozet Tunnel","596-598 Swannanoa Ln Lyndhurst, Virginia, 22952 United States",38.0281,-78.8689,phreddievonshiredadDayneMom0jaryanlittlephotoshansenn603qryanlittlephotoShutterShellesshiredadrrfinkelsDaynesshansenn603qhrnickMom0ja,2016-02-16 00:00:00,"Crozet Tunnel,The Monroe Institute,Frontier Culture Museum ,American Shakespeare Center's Blackfriars Playhouse","Vaile Mansion,Seiberling Mansion,Kleine Trippenhuis,Allison Mansion",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/swannanoa-palace
477,Gungywamp,"lost tribes,subterranean sites,ruins",115,961,"Gungywamp in Groton, Connecticut is the kind of site that can drive archaeologists crazy.It’s a very messy story. The site, located in the Connecticut woods less than an hour away from New Haven, consists of multiple stone chambers, rings of stones, piles of rock, Native American artifacts, mysterious etchings, lithic artifacts, Colonial artifacts, and hundreds—perhaps thousands—of years of various settlers adopting and rearranging the site. It’s difficult to tell where one historical period ends and another begins.The site attracts what might be called archaeological conspiracy theories. Among the most popular of these theories (one that crops up at multiple stone sites in the Northeast, like New Hampshire’s Mystery Hill) is that the site is a pre-Colombian settlement built by 6th-century Celtic Christian monks who escaped Ireland to avoid Norse aggression.While it is easy to dismiss this theory, the confirmation of pre-Columbian Norse contact in Newfoundland, and the suggestion that Polynesians may have had contact in South America make it difficult for some to dismiss out of hand. No findings confirming the theory have ever been found by any credible linguists, epigraphers, or archaeologists, making it still a fringe theory at best.Even less credible theories involving aliens, some unknown group of ancient peoples, and energy vortexes (yes, really) also surround the site. Frustratingly for some tour guides, the site exhibits occasional spikes in electromagnetic activity on a magnetometer. This is believed by some geologists to be the result of the composition of quartz, granite and magnetite rocks, but that does little to dissuade those who want to believe Gungywamp is a UFO-influenced energy vortex.What has officially been found at Gungywamp is no less confusing or mysterious. A lithic stone pounding tool found there dates to at least 1500 B.C., which is pre-tribal Native American. The site certainly has plenty of indigenous artifacts including arrowheads, stone flakes, and pottery fragments. The Native American inhabitants may also be responsible for the stone circles, which some believe are astronomical tools and which others believe are colonial mill or hide tanning areas.However, it is the multiple stone chambers that get people the most excited. Thought by most to be root cellars built by colonial settlers, they have some strange properties, including one that’s designed to line up with the equinoxes, so that light shines though a small window. This seems not to fit with the work of colonial settlers. Prominent 30-foot rock ledges and an eagle petroglyph only provide further mystery and confusion to the site.Whether constructed by Colonial-era European settlers, slaves in colonial times, by Native Americans such as the Pequot or Mohegan tribes, or even (however unlikely) by Irish Monks, the site will no doubt provide plenty of work, and frustration, to archeologists for many years to come.We explored Gungywamp on Obscura Day - March 20th, 2010.

As early as 2000 BCE, Timucuan Native American populations thrived in the area until widely being wiped out by war and diseases brought by European settlers.  Dr. Andrew Turnbull, Scottish physician and entrepreneur, settled here in 1768 and named the area Smyrna in honor of his wife who was born in Smyrna, Asia Minor (now Izmir, Turkey).  New Smyrna became the largest British colony attempt in the New World.Henry Cruger and William dePeyster bought 600 acres of land here in 1830 and established a sugar plantation.  The plantation originally consisted of a sugar mill and a saw mill, both built from coquina quarried in the area. Coquina, or “tiny shell,” was first used by the Spanish. It contains mollusk shell fragments and quartz sand, bound together by calcium carbonate. Machinery for the mills, much advanced for the time and area, consisted of steam-driven rollers financed by investors from New York. Unfortunately for the owners and investors, the mills and surrounding buildings were burned down by the Seminole Indians during the Second Seminole War in 1835. The plantation’s own slaves aided in the raid.The area was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in August 1970.

The small church and family graveyards of the time were simply unequipped to deal with the number of daily deaths occurring in the city. A group of town elders, led by the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, had a novel idea. They wanted to create a large, nondenominational, non-profit cemetery that could also serve as a peaceful public park. In 1845, the Spring Grove charter, prepared by future Supreme Court Justice Salmon P. Chase and others, was granted by the Ohio State legislature. Spring Grove Cemetery was born.Famed landscape architect Adolph Strauch was hired to develop the grounds. Strauch, the originator of the now popular “lawn plan” for cemeteries, developed the landscape in accordance with the area’s scenic hills. He planted trees from around the world, created lakes with islands, preserved forested areas, and installed footbridges and winding paths. The grounds would eventually feature 12 ponds, multiple chapels, and numerous elaborate mausoleums. The most famous is the gothic revival Dexter family mausoleum, designed by architect James Keys Wilson. Not surprisingly, the cemetery was soon a popular picnicking spot for locals and tourists alike.The sprawling cemetery is also the eternal home of numerous famous residents. Notable interments include: Salmon P. Chase (Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court), Joseph Hooker (Civil War General), William Procter and James Gamble (Founders of Procter and Gamble), Bernard Kroger (Founder of Kroger), and Waite Hoyt (Hall of Fame pitcher for the NY Yankees).  On the National Register of Historic Places since 2007, Spring Grove is considered one of the jewels in Cincinnati’s crown.

Not only have the dogs been plummeting to their deaths from the bridge, but many have witnessed the animals actually climbing the parapet wall before making the jump. Even stranger are the reports of dogs surviving their brush with death, only to return to the bridge for a second attempt.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has sent representatives to investigate, but they too were stumped by the cause of the strange behavior.In truth, it is almost certain that these dogs are not “committing suicide,” (a concept that makes little sense in reference to animals) and that they do not intend to die, but rather something is luring them off the bridge before the dogs have time to realize the height. Though many theories have arisen on why these doggy “suicides” occur at such a regular pace, perhaps the best theory is that a mink is marking the area with very strong scent, and that scent, combined with the bridge wall, which makes it impossible for the dogs to realize the height, send the canines leaping over the edge after the compelling scent.While this lines up with the evidence—such as the deaths having occurred on sunny, dry days when the scent would have been strongest and with the timeline of mink introduction to Scotland—this no doubt does little to soothe the troubled soul of the dog’s owner, who has lost a furry friend.",This Scottish bridge seems to compel dogs to leap to their death. ,"The Ruins of St. Peter's Seminary,Dumbarton Rock,Formakin House","Milton, Scotland, G82 2TH United Kingdom 55.9366, -4.5215NearbyDumbarton Rock1.61 milesFormakin House2.33 milesThe Ruins of St. Peter's Seminary5.17 miles",55.9366,-4.5215,GenkiRachelmbisonGavinXoanjjtip27jjjtip27Alice From OnlineMMrCarlGavinXXoanRachelFFacebook620195281mmbison,2014-11-04 00:00:00,"Dumbarton Rock,Formakin House,The Ruins of St. Peter's Seminary,McMonagle's","Princeton Chapel Bulldog,Vigilant Firehouse,Rattlesnake Bridge,Big Dog and Sheep",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/overtoun-bridge

There is an underground salt museum and tram tour. There is, however, an even more unusual aspect to this site. The museum contains a 250-million-year-old salt crystal in which a living bacterium was discovered in 1998.Two biologists and a geologist discovered the 2-9-3 virgibacillus bacterium in a drop of seawater trapped in the salt crystal, 1,850 feet underground near Carlsbad, New Mexico. Bacteria have the ability to go into a kind of semi-permanent hibernation, but to survive for this long was unheard of. Scientists re-animated the bacterium, which had lain dormant in the salt crystal for 250 million years, by adding fresh nutrients and a new salt solution.Dr. Russell Vreeland, one of the biologists who found the bacterium, pointed out that bacteria can survive the forces of acceleration via rubble thrown off by a meteor impact. In a sort of reverse “exogenesis” Vreeland pointed out it is possible that earth’s own microbes are already on Mars.“When man goes to the stars, our microbes will be waiting for us,” Vreeland said.Today at the Underground Salt Museum you can see the piece of salt crystal where the bacteria was found, as well d in the museum.

486,The Underground Home,"world's fair,secret,nuclear,subterranean,eccentric homes,homes",80,959,"In the 1960s, the Cuban Missile Crisis posed a real and present danger. In response, the New York City World’s Fair of 1964-65 rolled out a Soviet-free solution: the simply-named “Underground Home,” a subterranean dwelling complete with night-and-day light dials, a pipe organ, and candelabras. Now, 50 years later, the question remains: is the Underground Home still there?Built 15 feet underneath what is now Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, the Underground Home was the dream of builder Jay Swayze, who lived in his own subaltern abode in Texas. Swayze and his team constructed a huge concrete shell beneath a marsh in the park, completing the home itself with gypsum board ceilings.The Underground Home was designed to give the owner complete authority over his environment, and included temperature controls, city views (the model on a pamphlet depicted the New York skyline on one side, the Golden Gate bridge on the other), and choice of climate. It even included a terrace and flower garden.By most accounts, the home—and the subsequent underground home building projects the model was supposed to spur—were flops. Unlike snazzier, free exhibits the fair boasted, the Underground Home charged a dollar admission. Additionally, Swayze sold the homes themselves for a pricey $80,000—nearly $500,000 by today’s standards. The New York Times said that by the end of the fair, no homes had been sold.Perhaps because of its fair failure, some people believe that Swayze never fully removed the home in order to save the contract-mandated demolition fees the removal would run him. Although the home’s furnishings were certainly removed from the house after the fair, Dr. Lori Walters, a historian from the University of Central Florida, is lobbying the New York Parks department for permission to excavate to see if the shell of the home is still underground. A dig may be the only way to end the debate.","A hyper-luxurious, 12,000- square foot home might be buried beneath Queens, still waiting to protect you from nuclear missiles. ","Louis Armstrong House,Panorama of the City of New York ,Fountain of the Planet of the Apes","Flushing Meadows-Corona Park 11101 Corona Ave Queens, New York, 11368",40.7441,-73.8593,Alicia BonesnoahbrittonMartin,2013-01-16 00:00:00,"Fountain of the Planet of the Apes,Panorama of the City of New York ,Louis Armstrong House,Flushing Meadows-Corona Park","Lookout Mountain Airforce Station,Villa Rose ,Crocodile Harry's Underground Nest & Dugout,Catherine de Medici's Chamber of Secrets",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-underground-home-2-queens-new-york

It also marks the western end of Carroll Avenue, an old freight corridor that brought traffic to the bridge and yet remains, though largely forgotten and invisible in the modern cityscape.To understand the significance of Carroll Avenue, it helps to understand the history of the Kinzie Street Railroad Bridge. Located at a historically well-trafficked point of crossing, the current bridge was preceded by the first bridge ever built across the Chicago River (a pedestrian bridge built in 1832), the first railroad bridge built in Chicago (replacing the pedestrian bridge in 1852), and one of the first all steel railroad bridges in the United States (replacing the previous bridge in 1879). The current bridge replaced that bridge in 1908, and it was, at the time of its completion, the longest and heaviest bascule bridge in the world.The crossing point was important because it was the most obvious place to move people and goods from the north shore of the Chicago River to the train yards on the west side of the river’s forks. Although passenger train traffic ceased in 1911, the industrial activity in downtown Chicago ensured that this remained an important freight artery throughout most of the 20th century. The rail lines that extended from the Kinzie Street Railroad Bridge all the way to Navy Pier carried Baby Ruths and Butterfingers for the Curtiss Candy Company, newspapers for the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, supplies for the Jardine Water Purification Plant on Lake Michigan (the largest capacity water filtration plant in the world), retail and wholesale goods to the Merchandise Mart (the largest building in the world when it opened in 1930), and any other freight that was part of the busy economic life of the area.All that remains of this once-important freight line is Carroll Avenue. As industry moved out of the area in the late 20th century, train traffic dried up until, in the 1990s, only the Sun-Times still used the rails, sending one newspaper-laden train per day from their downtown printing plant. When that facility was moved in 2000, the Kinzie Street Railroad Bridge was raised and the train tracks that run down the middle of Carroll Avenue have lain disused ever since.Carroll Avenue, though, does not go unused. While multiple sections of the street are blocked off to regular traffic, the large basement loading docks that once flanked the rail lines have been converted to parking lots and the street is frequently used for deliveries, garbage pickup, and contractor access for the buildings above. Musicians performing at the House of Blues find that Carroll Avenue provides conveniently inconspicuous access to the venue. And the Kinzie Street Railroad Bridge — designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007 — is still owned by Union Pacific, who lower it and drive a pickup truck across it once per year to maintain their right of way. Suggestions to turn the street into a public transit corridor have yet to bear fruit.",A little-known subterranean street runs under some of the best-known buildings in Chicago's River North. ,"Heald Square Monument's Statue of Liberty,Lower Lower Wacker Drive,S.S.

492,Leavenworth's Bavarian Village,"wondrous performances,outsider architecture",1583,957,"“…a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and stuck all over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture.”Ernest Hemingway always did have a way with words, and although the above quote is his reaction to visiting Switzerland, it could just as easily describe the charming village of Leavenworth, Washington.Visitors to this mountain-walled hamlet will instantly recognize the faceted buildings, wooden balconies and two-toned timber frames of the houses and shops speckled throughout as a style directly imported from the famous European Alps, and the German Alps to be more specific.Sometimes confused with the more popularly known Swiss style of architecture, Leavenworth is actually a very intricate, very carefully planned destination in the particular style of Bavaria, complete with a festive culture of merriment, beer drinking and cozy fireplaces.It wasn’t initially planned to be what it is today, however. It was originally a fully American mountain town of the Pacific Northwest, with a thriving timber industry and railroad-supported economy. That all changed half a century ago when the railroad left and the timber industry and its jobs followed.Like so many towns transformed by the whims of the economy, Leavenworth teetered on the brink for decades as people left and the streets emptied. In the 1960s, in a rather remarkable example of communal effort, the town decided that decline was not the only transformation it could make. Surrounded by snowcapped mountains and miles of natural beauty, a seasonal tourist town seemed like a natural fit – but making that happen is easier said than done. Tourists tend to choose their destinations, not the other way around.An Alpine theme of Bavarian history, festivities, and intrigue was suggested, and then put into swift action by innkeepers and shop owners on main street, who redesigned the buildings from head to toe, inside and out, in the style of the Bavarian villages of old.It worked. The whole town took part in the transformation, and the present-day Leavenworth is the spitting image of the many mountain villages of Old Europe, and thus is overrun with travelers and tourists during the traditionally busy festival seasons of Maifest, Oktoberfest and Christmas. It may seem prefabbed and strange to some, but Leavenworth deserves its success, having taken its fate into its own hands and charted a fresh economic course into the new century.",One small town in the Pacific Northwest transformed itself into a Bavarian-themed tourist destination. ,"9/11 Spirit of America Memorial,Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum,Wellington Avalanche Site","Leavenworth Leavenworth, Washington, 98826 United States",47.5798,-120.6581,Mark CaseyRachelTaterchipstonyanrobMartinFairy Princess Lolly,2012-10-01 00:00:00,"Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum,9/11 Spirit of America Memorial,Wellington Avalanche Site,Iron Goat Trail","Leaning Tower of Tbilisi,Mosaic House of Dunedin,Enchanted Hart Haus ,Castillo Monumento Colomares",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leavenworths-bavarian-village

More often than not, Floridians identify freshwater with swampland, mosquitos, snakes and alligators – not to mention the general air of unfavorable comparisons to the miles of sandy beaches nearby.Vortex Spring is an exception. Steadily fed by the cool water of an underground river, the spring is a refreshing oasis in the middle of the Florida panhandle. Unlike lakes that can stagnate (and become the perfect home for certain reptilian creatures that are as deadly as they are lazy), the constant flow of water keeps Vortex Spring clear, cool and generally pristine.That goes double for the vast underwater cavern that truly makes this spring special. Extending more than 1,600 feet (that have been measured so far) into the limestone bedrock, Vortex Spring conceals one of the largest known underground caves in the southern United States – a fact that has not been overlooked by cave divers around the world.Professional cave divers travel for miles to experience the cavern, which offers a more hospitable environment than most due to the fresh and always-flowing water. Comparable dive sites are often found in much harsher, bacteria-ridden saltwater locations, or in the icy depths of glaciers. For this reason, Vortex Spring has become a popular dive training facility, offering classes and unique opportunities to novices and professionals alike.The cavern begins just 58 feet below the water’s surface but extends far beyond that. Experienced cave divers are allowed to travel to a depth of 115 feet (though the cave is technically open to a depth of 310 feet, at which point it is barricaded for safety).

Either way, the constant presence of “surprise” water pouring out of this hole and into that trench made the mine a very difficult work environment.All along the underground trail are signs pointing to the evidence of drilling work and other interesting facts about the mine itself, which actually never managed to produce any gold. While sadly it turned out to be a bust during the mining boom, Vera Eklund, who purchased the mine in 1943 after spotting water pouring out of the mountain during a train ride, turned it into cash of another color by transforming it into a tourist stop.Thunderhead is the oldest mine open to the public in the Black Hills area.Update May 2017: This place is closed down, out of business.

The stars of the collection are the two mummies, who are estimated to date back to the 21-22 Dynasties approximately 3500 years ago.Nes-Per-N-Nub, a mummy whose rare, triple nesting sarcophagi indicates former great import, as the doorkeeper in the temple of Amun, is thought to hail from Thebes. The second, unnamed mummy is a female who is often referred to as The Yellow Mummy due to her sarcophagus’ brilliant color, and is remarkable for having extra sets of bones within the folds of her wrappings.Recent scientific studies have shown that members of Egyptian society’s class worthy of such immortal preservation were plagued by worn teeth, periodontal diseases, abscesses and cavities, as well as arteriosclerosis (the hardening of arteries). Though CT scans have not shed light on The Yellow Mummy’s cause of death, they have shown that Nes-Per-N-Nub died of natural causes and revealed that he was not immune to such maladies, as the poor guy suffered from a history of both cavities and arthritis.Unfortunately, all records of Sutro’s purchase of his Egyptian treasures were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire. Renowned for a populist ethos that extended well beyond his term as Mayor, Sutro displayed his collection at the Sutro Public Baths from 1895 to until the baths’ scheduled demolition in 1966. The collection had, conveniently enough, already been moved from the building before the night that the Sutro Baths burned to the ground under dubious circumstances.The collection was housed for a time at the University of California Extension Center, but the mummies, various body parts, and the rest of the artifacts found their current final resting place at the Classics Department of San Francisco State University in 1972. In order to better showcase and utilize this wonderful collection, a Museum Studies Department was founded in 1987 to teach museum theory and design as well as proper archival practices.The University’s Museum Studies program displays an array of Sutro’s collection at their biannual public exhibition. The mummies are regularly featured in these exhibits, placed beneath glass plates with small holes where the curious can muster their bravery to take a whiff of ancient times.Obscura Day location: April 9, 2011.Update as of December 2020: The collection can currently be found on the campus of San Francisco State University.","Tenacious mummies survived dental problems, eternal entombment, and more than their fair share of devastating fires. ","Urbano Sundial,Gregangelo Museum,Broderick-Terry Duel Site","1600 Holloway Avenue San Francisco, California, 94132 United States",37.7227,-122.4801,littlebrumblembisonAnnetta BlackClaymoreBart BernhardtXofBart BernhardtClaymoreNicholas JacksonmmbisonXXofAnnetta Black,2011-03-16 00:00:00,"Urbano Sundial,Gregangelo Museum,Broderick-Terry Duel Site,Doggie Diner Head","Egyptian Museum of Turin ,The Mummy Ankhefenmut,Maidstone Mummy,Ancient Egypt Museum of Shibuya",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sutro-egyptian-collection-skb

Indeed, it looks unlike any other church in the world. More than 6 million yellow bricks form a serene, minimalist look, juxtaposed with a soaring facade that evokes the shape of a church organ.Grundtvig’s Church was built to honor N.F.S. Grundtvig, a 19th-century Danish philosopher, historian, poet, and reformer. His influential ideas earned him a monument in his name, designed by master architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint shortly after World War I.The design is meant to be a synthesis of numerous building styles, merging the scale of Gothic vertical architecture with geometric expressionism and traditional Danish styles. Inspired by Grundtvig’s work, Jensen-Klint based the design primarily on the stepped gabled churches found in the local villages, but on a far grander scale. The massive church is 259 feet long with the nave soaring 72 feet high. The interior can hold about as many people as Copenhagen Cathedral. To balance the Gothic proportions of the interior, more than 6 million yellow bricks, a traditional Danish material, were uniformly used in keeping with classic Danish minimalism.

It’s an English Elm (Latin name: Ulmus procera), which is a tree known for having extremely strong wood—apparently strong enough to hang something as big as a school bus. On a sunny spring day, it doesn’t seem ominous, but the local legends would beg to differ. The Hangman’s Elm, as you might have surmised, is the supposed site where those sentenced to death by hanging met their fate.Sometimes just referred to as the “Hanging Tree,” it stands at 110 feet tall and was determined to be over 330 years old, according to the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. It’s hard to confirm whether it is indeed the oldest, but it’s definitely one of the very eldest in the city. That means it started spreading its branches just around the time “New Netherland” became “New York.” References to the tree as the “Hangman’s Elm” go all the way back to the 19th century.The tree apparently witnessed, and played a role in, a number of hangings—including those of traitors during the Revolutionary War. Newgate State Prison was once just around the corner on Christopher and 10th Streets, and inmates there might also have been brought to the elm for their executions. There are no public records to confirm any of these hangings, however historians do know that this area of Washington Square Park was once a burial ground for slaves and those who died of yellow fever. There has been at least one confirmed execution in this area, about 500 feet from the elm—that of Rose Butler in 1820, a slave accused of arson. During a soil testing project in 2008, archaeologists found four mostly intact skeletons. Many others have been found in the park, and left in the ground out of respect.Next time you wander by, take a look up through the branches and back in time. Hangman’s Elm reminds us that even as we sit below the shade of an a beautiful old growth tree in Washington Square park, we’re surrounded by hundreds of years of history— much of it sinister.",The oldest living tree in Manhattan comes shrouded in sinister legend. ,"C.

499,Austin Dam,"floods,disaster areas,disasters,ruins",178,955,"What was once a dam holding back a barrage of water is now the exact opposite.The dam failed less than a year after its completion in 1911, unable to hold back the massive potential energy of the water pooling behind it. When bowing started becoming apparent after only a few months, dynamite was used to blow a 13 ft. hole in the structure to release some of the pressure–it was no use.The failure was a disaster for the town of Austin, as the raging torrent of water unleashed by the crumbling of the dam destroyed numerous buildings and roads, including the paper mill that supplied most of the jobs and powered the economy of the town. Even worse, 78 people were killed in the disaster.Then, it happened again.In 1943, the dam that was built to replace the original also failed, but this time, fortune was on the side of Austin residents, and there were no casualties. Deciding to leave well enough alone, Austin decided against rebuilding for the third time.Generally speaking, a dam serves a singular purpose: to stop the flow of water, big or small. From beaver dams in tiny streams to massive hydroelectric dams that harness the power of raging rivers, they all impede the natural flow of water. Now that the mighty Austin Dam has cracked in two, and a gaping hole exists between the two listing sides of the once-effective concrete structure. Thus, what was once a (nearly) rock-solid structure holding back an entire reservoir of water is now little more than an impressive bit of scenery through which a river naturally flows.The ruins have influenced documentary filmmakers and authors, and the Potter County Fine Arts Council and the Austin Dam Memorial Association have found a way to make the cracked concrete slabs useful by throwing an annual music festival and light show at the site called “The Dam Show”.

The quarter-acre of Ireland on the edge of Manhattan is a memorial to the over one million Irish who died during the Great Famine of the 1840s, as well as those who continue to suffer from hunger.Designed by artist Brian Tolle, the Irish Hunger Memorial in Battery Park incorporates a Famine-era stone cottage brought over from County Mayo, Ireland, and reconstructed as the heart of the monument.

502,The Last Yogi Bear Honey Fried Chicken Restaurant,"cartoons,fried foods,endangered eats,roadside attractions",168,955,"In the 1960s, a restaurateur from Columbia, South Carolina, developed a method for infusing a honey flavor into fried chicken. Celebrity restaurants were all the rage at the time and the inventor, Gene Broome, began to seek a celebrity endorsement for his honey-flavored chicken restaurant. He was reportedly turned down by Jackie Gleason, among others, before settling on the cartoon character Yogi Bear (and presumably coming to some arrangement with Yogi Bear owners Hanna-Barbera for the naming rights).The new restaurant’s theme included a roadside neon sign representing a big, smiling Yogi Bear holding a chicken leg. Customers could choose between two-piece Boo-Boo Baskets, three-piece Cindy Bear Baskets, nine-piece Picnic Baskets (or “pic-a-nic,” as Yogi would pronounce it), or 21-piece Jellystone Baskets, along with sides and desserts. The store’s original location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, was a huge hit. Additional locations began to open across the Carolinas. Yogi Bear Honey Fried Chicken seemed poised to become a regional, if not a national, brand.That early success drew the gaze of fast-food giant Hardees Foods Inc. They arranged to purchase the franchise chain from Broome and his partners for $1 million, according to South Carolina’s Post and Courier. Reportedly, Hardee’s primary interest was the intellectual property behind the honey flavor infusion, and not the restaurant chain itself. As a result, future expansion of the Yogi Bear chain was halted. Existing restaurants slowly began to fail under the new corporate ownership. One by one, the locations began to close, with the second-to-last location closing in the late 1990s, leaving the outpost in Hartsville, South Carolina, as the sole remaining location.Diners in Hartsville are still greeted by a beaming Yogi as they pull into the parking lot. The menu remains largely the same and also features Southern staples such as fried chicken gizzards and sweet iced tea. The restaurant and its history are a point of pride for the local population and, despite the presence of modern fast-food chains, the citizens of Hartsville and the surrounding area still love their honey fried chicken and the restaurant enjoys a brisk business.",The sole remaining outpost of a once-thriving South Carolina chain still sells “pic-a-nic” baskets. ,"Blenheim Mineral Springs,Pearl Fryar Topiary Garden,The Button Museum","514 US-15 Business Hartsville, South Carolina, 29550 United States",34.3692,-80.0709,Bacon McBeardyasdonkargoodepeggyCollector of Experiences,2019-03-26 00:00:00,"Pearl Fryar Topiary Garden,The Button Museum,Blenheim Mineral Springs,Mars Bluff Crater","The Cartoon Saloon,Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum,Springfield Doughnut ,Mel Blanc’s Grave",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-last-yogi-bear-honey-fried-chicken-restaurant

They ponied up $10,000 (which eventually swelled to more than double that) and commissioned Wright to build them a house in the Hollywood Hills. For this project, Wright tried something a little different. The so-called Samuel Freeman house is made from 12,000 concrete bricks, which incorporated sand from the hillside sloping down below it. These are assembled in the “textile block” style, which evokes the appearance of quilted stone. This one went up in 1924. Around the same time, Wright designed three others in this style across Los Angeles. Many of the blocks are imprinted with distinctive shapes—though scholars haven’t agreed on exactly what they are. (Some think the ones on the Freeman House look like daffodils.) When the Freemans moved out, more than 60 years later, they entrusted the home to the University of Southern California School of Architecture. The school’s preservationists had their work cut out for them. In addition to existing wear and tear, the home sustained earthquake damage in 1994. Progress toward repairing it and insulating the structure against future rumbles has been somewhat fitful, and the home is currently closed to the public. Still, there’s plenty to appreciate from the outside.

With a water clearance of just around 30 feet, the bridge, which was opened in the same year as the shipping lane it runs over, must lift its length for almost every boat passing underneath. Originally only trolley cars could cross the bridge during the day, with the rest of the traffic across the bridge reserved for the evenings, making the constant opening and closing of the span not much of an issue. However today, with traffic across the bridge a constant, the bridge opens around 35 times, often creating long waits for drivers.Despite this minor nuisance, the bridge has been embraced by the surrounding bohemian community. The first major artistic change to the bridge was in 1985 when a vote at a street fair resulted in the bridge being painted blue. new features and decorations have continued to accumulate over the years. One of the control towers in the bridge is now home to a neon Rapunzel whose electric hair trails down the side of the wall, while on the opposite side another neon creation illustrates a fable of an elephant and a crocodile by Rudyard Kipling. One of the most recent additions is an electronic bike counter that displays the number of bicyclists that cross the bridge each day, adding the total to an ever increasing yearly goal meter.Given that the bridge is located in the same neighborhood that gave us the Fremont Troll, it is likely that the bridge will continue to see more flourishes down the years.     ","From a neon Rapunzel to a bike traffic meter to a street fair color scheme, the most opened drawbridge in the US is a veritable art gallery. ","Piece of the Berlin Wall at Cafe Turko,J.P.

508,Hampstead Pergola,"estates,trails,gardens,plants",273,954,"It’s likely that many a casual walker on Hampstead Heath has made the strange yet serene discovery that is the Pergola. With trellises and stone pillar draped in vines and exotic flowers, it provides a unique space for a quiet wander, and a grand venue for photo shoots.The Pergola was the product of William H Lever, later Lord Leverhulme, who made his fortune from selling soap. Having become monumentally rich, he purchased The Hill, a large house on Hampstead Heath. Buying up more land around his estate, he hired a landscape architect to improve the expanded gardens. Its centerpiece would be a raised walkway: the Pergola.Construction began in 1905, but building the Pergola was no easy task. The whole level of the garden needed to be raised, requiring a huge amount of soil and numerous workers—with no aid from mechanical diggers or earth-movers. Fortuitously, it was during the time that the Hampstead extension to the Northern Line was being dug. Ever the shrewd businessman, Lord Leverhulme negotiated for the spoil from the tunneling to be delivered to his land, for which he was even paid a nominal fee!The first part of the Pergola was completed by 1906, and Lord Leverhulme would later purchase more land, enabling him to extend the Pergola in both 1911 and 1925. After his death, the subsequent owners of The Hill were less invested in the Pergola, and its grandeur declined to the point that the once-grand walkway was almost falling down when the London  County Council took the structure and surrounding gardens into its care in 1960. In the many years since, the Pergola has undergone significant restoration.Today, it is open to all. The Pergola is a great place to escape the rush of London, as it’s a quiet space draped in blossoms during spring, bursting with green in summer, and covered with a carpet of orange and red leaves in autumn. Or perhaps it would be a good place to perambulate and discuss betrayal, being rather reminiscent of the gardens in HBO’s Game of Thrones.",This secluded walkway overlooks a magnificently wild London green space. ,"Former Decca Studios,Freud Museum London,Admiral's House","The Pergola Inverforth Close London, England",51.5652,-0.1837,AmunyAnkhesenraszabiandiSojobeckbeckybeccaAlice From Online,2018-10-22 00:00:00,"Admiral's House,Freud Museum London,Former Decca Studios,Isokon Flats","Laurel Hill House,Warner Castle,Orto di Olmo,Villa Farnese",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hampstead-pergola
509,Museum of Psychphonics,"wunderkammers,aliens,black history,music,museums and collections",118,951,"The Museum of Psychphonics is a modern-day wunderkammer,  ”a 4-dimensional theme song for the soul of American underground culture.” The museum’s small collection has at its core the lesser-told stories of Indianapolis’ history and its connection to African-American music, as well more general themes of Afrofuturism, says Michael Kaufmann, its founding director. It hits the lofty note, too, of the music of the spheres—there are planets hanging from the ceiling and it’s named after the sound of breath and the sound of mind.The museum is located in Indianapolis’ Fountain Square neighborhood, in the Murphy Building; to reach the museum, you enter into what looks like a very small record store and pass through a heavy red curtain, inspired by the one in a portrait of Charles Willson Peale, the early American painter and collector. Past the curtain is a warmly lit space, just 11 by 10 feet. The display case are made largely from old musical instruments; the collection includes “currencies of amusements and fallen empires,” like the Soviet Union, an ashtray from the Burger King where Elvis was spotted after his death, and samples of dirt from venerated places, including religious pilgrimage sites, places where UFOs were spotted, and the arena where Elvis gave his last performance. There’s also music—the 4th dimension—commissioned for the museum; one piece is inspired by Scapper Blackwell, a blues guitarist who recorded and was killed in Indianapolis.The main attraction, though, is the Parliament Funkadelic Baby Mothership, a prop from the group’s road show. The Baby Mothership flew over approximately 300 audiences: it would appear to land on stage, and the big Mothership would appear, from which George Clinton would emerge. The Parliament Funkadelic road manager Tom Battista is an Indianapolis native, and he and his family were responsible for creating the show’s props. When Kaufmann found out the Baby Mothership was still around, he thought:  “That’s too awesome to just have it in storage. We should put it on display and celebrate it.” He had been thinking for a long time about creating a wunderkammer of some kind and recruited artist Kipp Normand as the curator and designer of the project. The Museum of Psychphonics isn’t the sort of place with long, explanatory panels. There’s a pamphlet that visitors can take, but it’s designed to be read after a visit. “The didactic information is pretty limited,” says Kaufmann. “The museum asks more questions than it provides answers.”Update August 2018: The museum temporarily closed on July 22, 2017 to move to a new location. It is still closed as of August 2018.Update February 2019: The museum will reopen February 22 from 6 to 9 p.m., and Feb 23 from 12 to 5 p.m. Regular hours for the museum will be on First Fridays and by appointment throughout the year.  ","A modern-day wunderkammer dedicated to Indianapolis history, Afrofuturism, and musical vibrations. ","The Athenaeum,Market Street Catacombs,Indianapolis Moon Tree","1043 Virginia Avenue Suite 208  Indianapolis, Indiana",39.7528,-86.141,Sarah LaskowFelthbaikinangelilmizscareallGunslinger711showmestateofmind,2016-09-22 00:00:00,"Market Street Catacombs,The Athenaeum,Indianapolis Moon Tree,Chatham Passage","Birthplace of Buddy Guy,Birthplace of Country Music Museum,Albina Soul Walk,Dew Drop Jazz and Social Hall",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-psychphonics

Today, the thoroughfare remains a veritable entrance to some underground kingdom. The nearly 200-foot long tunnel was created by a pair of steel jackhammers that pounded away at either side of the tunnel until they nearly kissed in the middle. To avoid a potential romantic (if catastrophic) collision, the process was helped along by dynamite blasting that forced its way through the rock.Once completed the tunnel carved through a natural barrier known as the Ptarmigan Wall. The interior of the passage is unadorned with the craggy rocks walls exposed all around it.In 1975, sharply-angled steel doors were installed at both ends of the path, giving the tourist tunnel a surprisingly fortress-like feel.

In Vietnam, they built a form of “Lithophones” or musical instrument built from rocks, and some of these instruments date back nearly 2000 years.In Korea, they built Pyeongyeong, while prehistoric lithophone stones have been found in Orissa, India. All of which points to the fact that when humans find stones that can make music, they tend to take note.Near Butte, just such stones exist. Part of the edge of the Boulder Batholith, and found in a large jumbled pile of boulders, the rocks in this unique geologic formation chime melodically when tapped lightly with a crescent wrench or mallet.It is believed that the ringing is a combination of the composition of the rock and the way the joining patterns have developed as the rocks have eroded away, though ultimately a concrete scientific explanation has yet to be arrived at. Curiously, if a boulder is removed from the pile, it no longer rings.Slightly different pitches and timbres emanate from thousands of rocks in the formation, and in theory, Butte’s Ringing Rocks could form the basic ostinato for the “Music of the Spheres.”(Musica Universalis)","The rocks of a certain area of Butte, Montana give off a musical ring when hit. ","The Berkeley Pit,Our Lady of the Rockies,Socialist Hall","Whitehall, Montana, 59759 United States 45.9433, -112.2375Visit Website NearbyOur Lady of the Rockies10.77 milesSocialist Hall13.68 milesThe Berkeley Pit14.58 miles",45.9433,-112.2375,Kix6mbisonAbDomenchristinedascenzoLeslie McIntyre,2010-02-19 00:00:00,"Our Lady of the Rockies,Socialist Hall,The Berkeley Pit,Pekin Noodle Parlor","The Sonorous Stones of Ringing Rocks Park,Singing Sand Dunes of Liwa,Booming Dunes of Badain Jaran Desert,Musical Stone of Gobustan",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ringing-rocks-of-montana

515,Burke Ghost Town,"mining,railroads,ghost towns,hotels,mountains,abandoned,architectural oddities,architecture",180,950,"Burke, Idaho, is not your run-of-the-mill ghost town. Its story starts out familiar: The mining town rose up after rich deposits of silver and lead were discovered in 1884. But the boomtown that developed was situated in a comically narrow canyon, resulting in some wonderfully creative architecture.Burke Canyon is long and thin, only 300 feet wide at its narrowest point. It’s a seemingly impossible space to fit a whole town into, and yet they did. The train tracks and the road for vehicles both shared the main street, so cars and carriages had to pull over when the train rolled by. Stranger still, the railroad was built right through the lobby of the town’s hotel.The Tiger Hotel was built in 1896, straddling the main street and the creek that ran through the canyon. When the railroad expanded in 1906, the lack of space forced it to run right through the hotel. A covered walkway crossed over the tracks connecting the two sides of the building, and five cars of the Northern Pacific Railroad passed through the tunnel in the hotel each day.Like so many mining towns in the Old West, Burke began to decline at the beginning of the 20th century and the mines starting shutting down. By 1990 there were reportedly just 15 residents left in town. The last of the mines closed in 1991, and within a few years, there was no one left in Burke.Some of the old buildings have been destroyed by fire, floods, or time, including the unusual Tiger Hotel, which shuttered in 1954. But the decaying remains of many of structures, deserted mining equipment, and abandoned artifacts can still be seen around town.

On the far side of the square are a pair of double doors which lead into one of the most curious, dark, and transportive museums in eastern Europe.The dark, immersive gallery of the Franz Kafka Museum exhibits the author’s personal artifacts next to eerie representations of his ideas. The museum plays between the lines of fact and fiction, reality and fantasy, to illustrate how Kafka was affected by Prague, and in turn how the city was shaped by his writing about it. The schools, apartments, offices, and streets Kafka frequented appeared in his stories as allegories for various kinds of suffering. Divided into two parts, “Existential Space” and “Imaginary Topography,” the museum draws a rope taut through the life of Kafka. Through a cornucopia of letters, journal entries, photographs, eerie soundscapes, and 3D installations, it weaves a tapestry of intellectual, artistic, experiential, and nightmarish displays. Various mechanical statues illustrate the writer’s strange, sometimes absurd ideas, such as David Černý’s pissing fountain in the museum courtyard. The exhibit mimics the surreal effects of Kafka’s writing, haunting the visitor long after the experience is over.","An eerie, existential museum dedicated to the author of ""The Metamorphosis."" ","Proudy,Vinárna Čertovka,Location of Saint John of Nepomuk's Martyrdom","2A Cihelná Prague, 118 00 Czechia",50.088,14.4105,Alfred Lord TennisanyoneSebastian WortysMolly McBride Jacobsonreley250breaingramhrnick,2017-04-06 00:00:00,"Proudy,Vinárna Čertovka,Location of Saint John of Nepomuk's Martyrdom,Vojan Gardens","Karuizawa Picture Book Forest Museum,The Writers' Museum,Willa Cather Prairie,Cuypers Library",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/franz-kafka-museum
517,Battery Steele,"military history,world war ii,military",310,951,"Battery Steele military reserve rests in a marsh at the southeastern side of Peaks Island, on the ocean edge of Casco Bay in Portland, Maine. Completed in 1942, Battery Steele was built to replace aging structures throughout the coastal defenses of the United States.On Peaks, as part of the defenses, there totaled 58 military structures, known as the Peaks Island Military Reservation. Among these structures were gun emplacements, range-finding bunkers, fire-control posts, barracks, watchtowers, and searchlight bases. Today out of the 58 structures that were on the island, many still exist, but no where close to those original numbers.Outside of the Battery Steele gun emplacement, fire control towers still stand, range-finding bunkers stare out at the ocean, and various other buildings of differing uses dot the 14 acre site. Some of the structures have been incorporated into private residences, and some sit on private land not available to the public. Others are part of the Peaks Island Land Preserve, which is open to anyone for exploration. With hiking trails and markers pointing out military sites of historical significance, the previous military compound offers well groomed trails to explore and hike. The structure of Battery Steele is dark and tomb-like, so bring a flashlight. The structures are built into berms, with a 300-foot cement corridor connecting the previous gun emplacements. Concrete walls 18 inches thick blank out all light. Rooms that jut off the long, darkened hallway have graffiti adorning their surfaces. One room, down a set of stairs, is flooded with water four to five feet deep. Battery Steele has gained National Registry of Historic Places status in recent years. It is an important part of Peaks Island and military history. Although the guns are gone from the structures, the buildings still stand as if waiting for an attack. In recent history, the monolithic structure of Battery Steele was used to host the alternative art installment of Sacred and Profane. Lasting over a week, performance art, environmental art exhibits, and many other modern sculpture and abstract art adorned the dark spaces. This event no longer exists, but artwork still remains on the walls of some rooms. To reach the island, take the Casco Bay Ferry from the Maine State Pier. Use the Peaks Island Preserve map to find the multiple military sites. You will find the trails marked. Also, expect to get wet inside the structures. One access point is through a marsh, and depending how much rain has fallen, you may make it through dry. ",Explore the dark underground corridors of this graffiti-covered former military fortification. ,"Fort Gorges,Goddard Mansion,Umbrella Cover Museum","Florida Avenue Peaks Island Portland, Maine",43.6576,-70.1828,origamidondrscott,2016-06-02 00:00:00,"Umbrella Cover Museum,Fort Gorges,Goddard Mansion,Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad Museum","USS Hornet Sea, Air and Space Museum,Höckerlinie Westwall,La Coupole,Weeksville Airship Hangar",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/batterysteele-peaksisland
518,Mount Hood,"state high points,geographic markers,mountains",1505,951,"One of the most recognizable and climbed mountains in the world, Mount Hood can be a relatively short climb, but climbers should definitely come prepared to spend a long day on the mountain, for severe weather that can happen at any time, and to avoid dangerous ice and rock falls.Many routes are available to the highest point in Oregon, which is at the summit of Mount Hood at 11,239 feet above sea level. Most of these routes require some technical rock and ice climbs, but the standard route, known as the Hogsback or South Side Route, is a hike that starts at the Timberline Lodge and then leads to a short snow climb. Guide services may even make the trip shorter by driving groups up in a snowcat to beyond the lodge’s ski lifts. A persistent urban legend states that the mountain was even once climbed by someone in high heels.While the standard route is relatively short, that does not mean “easy and safe.” Climbers must start very early in the morning (an “alpine start”) to avoid melting snow, dangerous falling ice, and hazardous loose rock. An area of active fumaroles known as the “Devil’s Kitchen” is near the summit and should not be approached because of the risk of suffocation. Due to the popularity of the Hogsback, a slow party may cause a traffic jam at various places with rising temperatures and increasing risks. Over 130 people have died on this mountain, some while rescuing others, like those in a helicopter crash in 2002. All climbers must carry a Mountain Locator Unit, or MLU, on their climb, available for rent at most Portland-area outdoor sporting goods shops for about $5.Multiple companies in the area offer guided services up the mountain, and some train prospective climbers in using mountaineering equipment and techniques before the climb up one of the world’s most infamous mountains. ",Despite a legend that says this highest peak in Oregon was climbed in high heels scores of people have died on its slopes. ,"National Neon Sign Museum ,Timberline Lodge,Fire Museum in City Hall","Mount Hood, Oregon, 97041 United States 45.5381, -121.5672Visit Website NearbyTimberline Lodge15.89 milesFire Museum in City Hall19.05 milesNational Neon Sign Museum 19.06 miles",45.5381,-121.5672,thomasharperWhiskeyBristlescharleskelsoivheychristyAty TrociousBlindcolour,2014-08-05 00:00:00,"Timberline Lodge,Fire Museum in City Hall,National Neon Sign Museum ,Friend Ghost Town","Denali,Mount Rainier,Gannett Peak,Granite Peak",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-hood
519,The Hat Museum,"eccentric homes,homes,collections,museums and collections",154,950,"The quirky Ladd-Reingold House has been through an array of interesting circumstance. The house was built in the early 1900’s in the west coast’s first attempt at city planning, called Ladd’s Addition. William Ladd, a former Portland mayor, had visited Washington, D.C., and shamelessly copied a city layout he had seen there that featured prominent circular and diamond-shaped gardens.The Ladd-Reingold house was one of the first houses built in the new development. Rebecca Reingold moved to Portland from Russia and bought the house while it was still new. The last Reingold left the house over 60 years ago, but the eccentric family’s legacy remains.Besides the strange design of the house which includes pocket doors, a secret hiding place, doors hung backwards and a dumbwaiter, there are more obvious eccentricities, like the giant-sized mermaid painted on the dining room ceiling. Not to be outdone by the house, Rebecca Reingold was a character herself, and was quite fond of collecting hats, all of which remained in the house long after she was gone. She also learned to make hats, and became a women’s hat maker, or ‘milliner.”After being abandoned for about 5 years in the 70’s, a new owner with a very coincidental passion for headwear bought what she initially called “The Monster House,” unknowingly inheriting a hat collection that rivaled her own. After some remodeling and moving in her own fine collection of dice, mermaids, hamburger related items, hands, and of course hats, Alyce Cornyn-Selby turned the house into a museum to share her treasures.Many hat categories reside in the 1910 Craftsman-style home- include vintage, men’s, women’s, Victorian, Edwardian, silly, novelty, retro, and international. Also featured in the museum is movie memorabilia, some rare designer hats, and for those that just aren’t that easily impressed, a Thanksgiving table hat that sings.Update as of February 2020: Alyce Cornyn-Selby no longer owns and operates the museum, the museum is now operated by a family friend. ","Their motto is, ""We've been bonkers for hats even longer than you have!"" ","Creepy's ,Rimsky-Korsakoffee House,Kidd's Toy Museum","Ladd-Reingold Historic House 1928 S.

521,B-17 Bomber Crash Site,"crash site,aircraft,hiking,world war ii,military",113,949,"A moderate six-mile hike through the National Forest leads to a fascinating array of wreckage from a World War II-era B-17 bomber. Among a handful of other crash sites in Colorado, this one stands out for how well-preserved the pieces are, as well as the scavenger hunt of trail directions to get to the site.On June 13, 1944, a B-17 bomber left its base in Rapid City, South Dakota, on a training flight. While the exact conditions causing the crash are not known, the area of northern Colorado where the wreck is located is notorious for challenging wind and weather patterns, and it was not uncommon at the time for young and inexperienced pilots to face these conditions.The plane crashed into the mountainside, killing four out of the 10 men on board. While cleanup crews removed the plane’s fuselage and guns after the crash, a wide variety of engine and body pieces still remain, more than 70 years later. The debris ranges from nearly full engines to large sections of the wings.The hike begins at the Flowers Trail trailhead inside the Jack’s Gulch campground, on Pingree Park Road. If Flowers Road is accessible you will be able to drive up the trailhead at the end of the road with a high clearance vehicle, otherwise, you will have to hike the old road into the trailhead. By following clues along the trail, and small green “B-17” tags marking the trees, you will eventually come across the wreckage site.The hike ends where the trail approaches a steep slope of boulders and a clearing in the forest where you will see the debris.

Over the next few years, thousands of visitors continued to shuffle through each day.At the time, the Beaux Arts building was one of the largest aquariums in the world, and a dispatch in the Detroit News noted “there or only some six or seven other permanent aquaria known.”   Designed by architects Albert Kahn and George D. Mason, the building featured a massive central tank, grand pillars, and an ornate facade. Above the entrance is a carving of Neptune, the Roman god of the seas, and the city’s seal and motto: Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus (“We hope for better things; it will rise from the ashes”).Over the next hundred years, this small structure on an island in the Detroit River, partway between the U.S. and Canada, would become the oldest continually operating aquarium in America.Local legend says that the basement was home to a Prohibition-era speakeasy, and that, during a time of cinched purses and hungry bellies, a sea turtle named “Big Pete” was sold to the local fish market, where it was fated to become soup. The building rebounded over the years: Tanks made from wood and glue were replaced with sturdy concrete ones, and at its height, the collection included more than 3,600 fish.The tanks were full of freshwater and saltwater fish until 2005, when the cash-stripped city closed the aquarium as a cost-cutting measure. Local citizens voted to reopen it, and spent years lobbying to do so. The Belle Isle Conservancy, a nonprofit volunteer group, restored and reopened the building in 2012. ",The Beaux Art aquarium boasts a vast collection of saltwater and freshwater fish on an island in the Detroit River. ,"Nancy Brown Peace Carillon,Fallow Deer at the Belle Isle Nature Zoo,Heidelberg Project","3 Inselruhe Ave Detroit, Michigan, 48207 United States",42.3379,-82.9856,roninsaintdanevilgreentriangleNicholas JacksonhrnicktcheriphotossaintdaneevilgreentrianglejjklumpphrnicktcheriphotoNicholas Jackson,2010-10-14 00:00:00,"Nancy Brown Peace Carillon,Fallow Deer at the Belle Isle Nature Zoo,Heidelberg Project,The Dequindre Cut Greenway","Muroto Schoolhouse Aquarium,Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium,Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens,The Blue Planet",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/belle-isle-aquarium

The belt employs friction to generate electricity the same way a prankster would when rubbing a balloon on top of someone’s head to make their hair stand up—except on a much larger scale. A large Van de Graaff generator can make an electric charge strong enough to shoot bolts of lightning and even power particle accelerators.The machine on display at the Boston Museum of Science is the star of the museum’s Theater of Electricity. Dr. Robert J. Van de Graaff, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, built it in the early 1930s to power the university’s particle accelerator.

524,Mile-High Steps at the Colorado State Capitol,"elevation,aletrail,stairs,geographic markers",1484,950,"Denver is known as the Mile High City, but you have to stand on the steps of the Capitol to properly reach those heights—the rest of the city comes up just a little bit short. Even at the State Capitol, achieving precisely 5,280 feet in elevation has been a bit finicky. Over the years, no fewer than three of the granite steps leading to the main entrance have been identified as the golden plateau.The 15th step is engraved with the words “One Mile Above Sea Level.” It held this distinction from 1909 to 1969, when a group of students from Colorado State University remeasured. Their calculations put a mile high on the 18th step, which prompted the installation of a bronze marker. In 2003, the elevation was measured again. This time, the researchers identified the 13th step as the correct benchmark. A brass medallion engraved with the silhouette of the Rocky Mountains was formally installed in a ceremony later that year (the governor gave the keynote).The difference between the 15th and 18th step is 3.03 feet and the discrepancy has to do with an update to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD), which is the standard control of orthometric height in the United States. The 1969 measurements had been done with a previous standard, not the NAVD of 1988, which remains in use today. Whether the mile-high marker is due for another move remains unknown, and visitors are welcome to attempt their own measurements and place their bets. But the best thing a visitor could do would be to turn away from the stairs and take in the view of the mountain range rising behind them. Whether on the 8th step or the 20th step—a little too high or a little too low—it’s not too shabby up there. ","The spot in the Mile-High City that's exactly 5,280 feet above sea level (at least for now).  ","""The Yearling"",'Unsinkable' Molly Brown House,History Colorado Center","200 E Colfax Ave Denver, Colorado United States",39.7392,-104.9848,hanawashcatAty Trociousbribolio,2017-05-07 00:00:00,"""The Yearling"",'Unsinkable' Molly Brown House,History Colorado Center,American Museum of Western Art","Todt Hill,Signal de Botrange,Bruère-Allichamps Borne Milliaire,Alicante Zero Level",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mile-high-steps-at-the-colorado-state-capitol

In 1777, the Quakers internally outlawed members of the church from enslaving people, and a community of formerly enslaved people settled alongside the Quakers in the area. These two groups would eventually work together to make the town a major waypoint on the Underground Railroad, helping enslaved people from the American South escape to the North.Starting in the early-1800s and continuing through the Civil War until the eventual abolition of slavery, the Underground Railroad was a loosely structured network of routes and safehouses that people escaping slavery would use to travel north, sometimes as far as Canada. The Underground Railroad Trail Experience was established by the Montgomery County Parks system to commemorate the county’s role in the historic operation, such as in 1857 when fugitive slave Dred Scott was given shelter at Sandy Spring and represented by the county attorney while the Supreme Court decided his fate.The hike starts at the historic Woodlawn Manor, an old plantation whose owners were kicked out of the Quaker church for refusing to free their enslaved laborers. The trail traverses the dense woods and meanders across fields and streams, passing by hollowed out trees that may have been used as food caches, and boulders that marked property boundaries and may have been used as trail markers for escaping slaves.Visitors will pass the small freshwater spring that gave Sandy Spring its name and finally end up at a large, 300-year-old white ash tree that stood in the center of the historic community and would have been a beacon, guiding those escaping slavery to a place where they could find some brief shelter and supplies before continuing their journey further north.",A trail through a historic Quaker town that outlawed slavery in 1777 and was a major waypoint on the Underground Railroad.  ,"The Red Door Country Store,National Capital Trolley Museum,The Triadelphia Bell","16501 Norwood Rd Woodlawn Manor Cultural Park Ashton-Sandy Spring, Maryland, 20860",39.1284,-77.0261,WhiskeyBristlesDCbmyersAFcatstaff4,2017-03-24 00:00:00,"The Red Door Country Store,The Triadelphia Bell,National Capital Trolley Museum,Aspin Hill Pet Cemetery","Chamberlain Freedom Park,Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island,Mount Zion Cemetery's Underground Railroad Shelter,John Brown Monument",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underground-railroad-experience-trail

It was a pretty spiffy place, well-appointed and well-staffed, which meant just about everyone from the Vikings to the Huguenots wanted a piece of them (mostly the Vikings, who sacked it with some regularity).In the middle of all the invasions and rebuilding, in 1067 coming home from his victory across the Channel, William the Conqueror stopped by for a re-consecration. With his protection, things started off again on a long course of (mostly) smooth sailing. The order was able to rebuild—spiritually, financially, scholarly, and artistically—although with some setbacks during the Huguenot Wars of the 16th century.Cut to the French Revolution, which dealt the monastery its final blow. The brothers were all dispersed, the abbey fell apart, and it was eventually sold off for scrap and stone. Over the next 60 years it was a ghost of its former self, until 1852 when it was recognized for its value as a landscape of exquisite ruins.

When he touched them, the statue reached out, grabbed his arm and held him there until the parishioners (many of whom happened to belong to the nearby butchers’ guild) discovered him. They couldn’t free the thief from the statue’s grasp so they were forced to amputate. As soon as the limb was severed, the statue dropped the arm and immediately returned to her normal pose. The arm was hung from a meat hook in the narthex as a remembrance and a warning and has been there ever since.Also of note is the beautiful tomb of Count Jan Vratislav of Mitrovice.

Entire rows are dedicated to soda (or “pop,” as they say in Cincinnati), hot sauce, and every variety of potato chip imaginable. Even insects have their own special area (bug kebabs, anyone?). There’s a massive beer and wine selection, and shoppers can drink while they explore.Beyond its ground kangaroo, kombucha beer, and tea flavored like chocolate-covered bacon, Jungle Jim’s is perhaps best-known for its unique décor. Miniature storefronts pay homage to architectural styles across Europe, and colorful characters greet guests as they move from aisle to aisle, including a lion singing Elvis’s greatest hits, a merry band of animatronic General Mills cereal mascots on a boat, and an enormous swinging, singing Campbell’s Soup can.In 2007, the store’s bathrooms won Cintas’ America’s Best Restroom Contest. At first glance, the restrooms look like individual, single-seat Porta-Potties. But each door actually leads down a hallway to the giant, multi-stall restroom inside.In 2012, the store opened a second location in Cincinnati.

531,Grave of John Wilkes Booth,"abraham lincoln,assassination,us civil war,presidents,crime,crime and punishment,graves,gravestones,cemeteries,history",275,947,"One of the top actors of his day, Booth assassinated President Lincoln on April 14, 1865, before being killed himself. But Booth had quite a journey on the way to death.After shooting the president, Booth jumped to the stage from Lincoln’s box at Ford’s Theater shouting “Sic semper tyrannis!”, breaking his leg in the process. He proceeded to escape through Maryland to Northern Virginia.While on the lam, Booth had his leg treated by a doctor who would later be tried for conspiracy. Booth and fellow conspirator David Herold hid in the swamps for nearly a week. By April 26, federal officers had cornered the men, who were hiding in a tobacco barn. Booth was coaxed out when only when the barn was lit on fire, but refused to surrender. As he ran out with guns up, Sergeant Thomas P. “Boston” Corbett shot him. The soldier maintained that he had only meant to disarm the man, but Booth only lived a few hours after the officers dragged his body to the farmhouse porch.Booth’s body was sewn into a horse blanket and transported back to Washington, D.C. on the Potomac River. He was autopsied in the Navy Yard and identified by, among other things, a tattoo of his initials on his wrist.First, he was buried in the Old Penitentiary, along with his co-conspirators who were hanged there. Booth’s remains were exhumed and reburied in a warehouse of the Penitentiary in 1867. Finally, in 1869, his remains were exhumed a third time and released to his family.The assassin’s body was transported to Baltimore, the city of his youth, and buried in the Booth family plot in Green Mount Cemetery. The family plot is easy to find due to Junius Brutus Booth’s towering obelisk. But the Booth family, John Wilkes’ brother Edwin in particular, believed that an elaborate headstone for John Wilkes might attract unwanted attention and vandalism. Visitors today believe the small, plain, unmarked headstone denotes John Wilkes Booth’s final resting spot. Though some believe the white stone in the Booth family plot is actually that of Asia Booth Clarke, John Wilkes’ older sister. In lieu of flowers or stones, people leave pennies behind on the headstone, as if to give Lincoln the final word. ",A blank headstone topped with a pile of pennies marks the final resting place of the infamous assassin. ,"The Owl Bar,Elijah Bond's Ouija Board Grave,'Man/Woman'","1501 Greenmount Ave Baltimore, Maryland United States",39.307,-76.6085,picodeorizabaallybrashersadbread99Molly McBride JacobsonalcesosharmelasieunarineJJulius Spadasadbread99shawnikusaallybrashersharmelasieunarineaalcesoMolly McBride Jacobsonwwjrandon,2017-01-17 00:00:00,"Elijah Bond's Ouija Board Grave,'Man/Woman',The Owl Bar,Graffiti Alley","Snook's Grave,Haymarket Martyrs Monument,Lee Harvey Oswald's Grave,Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grave-of-john-wilkes-booth
532,54 Columns,"sol lewitt,installations,public art,industrial,parks,sculptures,art",487,948,"However you see it, the often-overlooked installation created by famed artist Sol LeWitt in Atlanta’s historic Old Fourth Ward is a conversation starter. The public art piece “54 Columns” has been causing controversy since it was installed in the neighborhood in 1999.Some have wondered if the 54 concrete columns are there as a shell for a forthcoming structure, or the remnants of an already destroyed building. Some think the minimalist construction strains the boundaries of what we should consider art. Others admire the piece for the way the viewer can interact with it, moving in and out of the large columns. The structure is built out of 54 concrete columns ranging in height from 10 to 20 feet. LeWitt envisioned the work as a nod to the city’s urban surroundings (hence his use of an industrial material like concrete) and to Atlanta’s skyline (from a distance, the work takes on the appearance of a cityscape). The piece combines industrial elements with a more abstract representation to create what Gregor Turk, the county’s public art coordinator at the time, called “simultaneously lowbrow and highbrow.”Those who aren’t fans of the minimalist structure have made their objections known in a few ways. In 2003, neighbors who thought the concrete pillars weren’t exactly the look the neighborhood needed planted dogwood trees among the columns to cover up the view. The trees were removed after the city ruled “the trees spoiled the sanctity of LeWitt’s installation.” And in 2005, one of the structure’s columns was painted with bright pink latex paint. The work has inspired dance performances, photo shoots, and, well, derision through the years. But as Charles Taylor, whose family donated the land and financed the structure’s construction, noted in an interview about the piece, “Good public art creates some controversy.” ","Atlanta's strange assortment of concrete pillars inspires reflection in some, confusion in others. ","Fire Station No. 6,Atlanta's One-Person Jail Cell,Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room & Ping Pong Emporium","Glen Iris Dr  Atlanta, Georgia, 30312 United States",33.7616,-84.3675,tjmuehlemanAdventureBrojoylucenteMom0ja,2017-10-31 00:00:00,"Fire Station No. 6,Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room & Ping Pong Emporium,Atlanta's One-Person Jail Cell,Madam C.J.

Few North American cities, meanwhile, can boast histories as rich, as complex and as downright engaging as that of New Orleans. It’s only fitting, then, that in the heart of the Big Easy – that is, smack in the middle of the 1,300-acre urban oasis known as City Park – resides a thoroughly whimsical and impressive model train experience.The Historic New Orleans Train Garden, located in the park’s Botanical Garden, a treasure in its own right, features almost a quarter-mile of track carrying 1/22-scale streetcars and freight trains similar to those that wound through and around Crescent City a full century ago.What’s especially marvelous about this particular display, however, is the landscape the trains traverse. Designed by the ingenious artist Paul Busse, who for decades has created equally magical scenes in botanic gardens around the country, the small, dream-like buildings and iconic sights of New Orleans have been crafted from organic, natural, biodegradable materials. As visitors walk around the display, they can read about certain landmarks and neighborhoods (the Old Absinthe House; the Garden District; the St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square) that are “stops” along the trains’ routes.The Train Garden is open when  the Botanical Garden itself is open, but the trains run on a limited schedule, i.e., Saturdays and Sundays from 10:30 AM - 4:30 PM.",Tiny historical streetcars wind through a small scale version of Crescent City in this whimsical train garden.  ,"Holt Cemetery,The Luling Mansion,The Singing Oak ","5400 Stadium Dr New Orleans, Louisiana, 70124 United States ",29.988,-90.0993,Benedict CosgroveMike PortanovaIn Search of the Perfect Sunsethrnick,2016-05-04 00:00:00,"Holt Cemetery,The Singing Oak ,The Luling Mansion,The Oldest Fire Hydrant in New Orleans","Maine Central Model Railroad,Grand Maket Rossiya (Grand Model of Russia),Holiday Train Show at New York Botanical Garden,Crossville Model Railroad Club",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-orleans-train-garden

Using locally sourced lumber and stone, the creators of the lodging built up a tall cone. Water pours from the top down the sides in-between the guest windows, running under rich layers of jungle foliage growing on the exterior.Inside, each of the cozy suites is named after a local species of bird, and all feature a selection of modern amenities that rival even fancier hotels in less remote parts of the country. And if the strangeness and beauty of the hotel itself fail to impress, it offers a number of other attractions. Among the offerings are hot tubs “made out of huge trunks of trees, dug out, and then filled with hot water perched on a deck overlooking the forest.” There is also a mini golf course built into the forest itself, using the natural world as the obstacles, and there are various outdoor activities such as horseback riding, rafting, and hiking.Of course, getting to such a magical place takes a bit of doing.

537,The Daily News Building Globe,"globes,art deco,architecture",404,946,"The Daily News Building on Manhattan’s East 42nd Street is one of the city’s most historic Art Deco structures.Designed by John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood (the celebrated architect of other 20th century gems such as Rockefeller Centre, the McGraw-Hill, and the Chicago Tribune buildings) it was built between 1929 and 1930. It was the home of America’s first tabloid newspaper, the illustrious Daily News, until 1995. The outside of the building is exceptional enough on its own; a giant mural carved above the entrance in the Art Deco style depicts working Manhattanites under an illuminated sky and the motif “He Made So Many of Them.” But on walking into the building, visitors can find one of the city’s most spectacular architectural sights: a vintage globe that nearly dwarfs onlookers. Set into the floor at the exact axis of the miniature Earth and slowly revolving under a black glass sky, the giant globe was featured as part of the fictional Daily Planet in Richard Donner’s Superman films. The lobby still shows photographs of Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane at work in the hectic newspaper offices. Accompanying the massive model are brass meteorological instruments giving the day’s rainfall, wind velocity, and atmospheric pressure, whilst ornate clocks give the time in far-flung destinations such as Panama, Casablanca, Belgrade, and Berlin. Inscribed on the floor surrounding the globe are the distances to such exotic locales as Cairo, Gibraltar, and the North Pole, suggesting to visitors not already bowled over by the remarkable lobby that New York was indeed the center of the world.At the time of its opening, the Daily News held the largest circulation of any newspaper in America. Its smaller size made it popular with subway commuters, and the emphasis on photography (a camera has been included in the paper’s logo since the first edition) gave the Daily News the moniker, “The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York.” The building was situated between 2nd & 3rd Avenue of 42nd Street so the noisy printing presses could be held in the same building as the editorial staff without disturbing upper-scale city dwellers. The Daily News may have moved on, but the journalists of WPIX-TV and the Associated Press still make their way to work following in the footsteps of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, as the giant globe silently turns on its axis, as it has done every day since 1930. ",Spinning silently in the lobby of an Art Deco masterwork is a massive vintage model of the Earth. ,"Sakagura,The Cartoon Wall at Overlook,New York's Hidden Tropical Forest","220 East 42nd Street New York, New York, 10017 United States",40.7499,-73.9732,Luke J SpencerMartinnhazleJaszmina Szendrey,2015-01-07 00:00:00,"Sakagura,New York's Hidden Tropical Forest,The Cartoon Wall at Overlook,U.N.

Underwater viewing stations allow visitors to see the manatees—and fish they swim with—up close and personal at this showcase for Florida’s native wildlife.Homosassa Springs was a popular train stop in the early 1900s, where people would take a much-needed rest while the trains reloaded. Passengers could swim and fish, and by all accounts, it was considered a beautiful spot to take a break.In a natural setting of wetlands and woods, the Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park hosts daily educational programs on alligators, Florida-based snakes, and more. The park houses black bears, river otters, cougars, foxes, bobcats, panthers, wolves, whooping cranes, and hundreds of birds. There is even a hippopotamus (behind his “Splatter Zone” warning signs). Homosassa Springs is home to “Lu,” the oldest living hippopotamus in North America.  Born at the San Diego Zoo on January 26, 1960, Lu has been a resident of the Park since 1964.  It’s just like a zoo, except the setting is much more natural, and all of the animals on display are native to the region – except, of course, for Lu.It’s not just the design and animals that attract visitors, though.

Refitted with a new interior in 1906, the bar maintains many of its historic fixtures, including stained glass windows, beautiful tiles depicting cherubs, and a wooden bar. There is even a brass water tap for topping off one’s whisky. Perhaps the most unusual feature, however, is what locals refer to as a “jug” or “snug.”At the time when this drinking institution opened its doors, alcohol was deemed by many to be a shameful vice. Notice the height of the stained glass windows at the entrance. Now they appear to be a merely aesthetic addition, but they were once a precautionary measure against prying eyes and a way to conceal the transgressions going on inside. As a result of this view of drinking and the behavior it typically inspired, bars were often considered “Men Only” premises. To accommodate women, a separate room, known as a “jug” or “snug,” was created. Detached, but adjacent, the small room was a supposed safe haven where women, or those who wished to avoid the raucous affairs taking place in the main portion, could enjoy a meal or even keep tabs on the proceedings in the next room.Bennet’s still features its secluded room, complete with its own entrance and serving hatch.

541,Fontanelle Cemetery Caves,"plague,ossuaries,catacombs and crypts,subterranean sites,caves,ecosystems,sacred spaces",247,945,"Like many ossuaries in Europe, the Cimitero Fontanelle began as a secondary burial ground when the churchyards and crypts began to overflow. Unlike other ossuaries, the skulls of the anonymous dead were lovingly cared for, named, and then asked for prophecies of winning lotto numbers.The offloading of temporarily buried remains into this cave on the outskirts of town began during the Spanish occupation of Naples in the 1500s, but the majority of its 40,000 residents came from the devastating plague outbreak of 1656 and smaller cholera epidemics in the 1830s.The 1656 plague arrived in January, and by August had claimed the lives of an estimated 150,000 people, or half the population of Naples. It took generations for the city to recover from the effects of the outbreak, and the victims died and were buried (or tossed into a cave) under the most chaotic of circumstances, often without last rites, almost always without any grave marker.In the tradition of the highly Catholic populace, these poor souls were trapped in a form of purgatory. The Fontanelle was a haunted place to be avoided at all costs, with the only exception being adding more bodies in times of outbreak. Over time, the ossuary became so crowded with haphazardly stacked bones and bodies that at one point during a heavy rainfall, the city was inundated by a flood of skulls and bones.Starting in 1872, Father Gaetano Barbati began the enormous task of cataloging and organizing the anonymous remains. They remained unburied, but were sorted and placed on shelves and racks, in boxes or crypts. As the remains were sorted, volunteers would pray for the deceased as they worked, the beginning an unusual relationship with the dead. Long-dead anonymous skulls were given names by the women who cared for them, who would often return to chat with or ask favors from the dead, placing wishes written on papers rolled up into the empty eye sockets.This “cult of the dead” sustained itself as a uniquely Neapolitan subculture until the bombings of World War II. Naples was the most heavily bombed city in Italy, and the Fontanelle, along with the other underground spaces in the city, served as a bomb shelter.The Fontanelle is a combination of natural caves, tufa mines, and ancient Greek and Roman tunnels. Naples, in the shadow of Vesuvius, is located in the Campi Flegrei, or “Fiery Fields,” an area of intense volcanic activity that has left the area riddled with caves, thermal springs, and craters. The early Greek residents of the area carved and quarried the soft volcanic stone, using some of the underground spaces as their own burial places. The Romans that followed dug networks of tunnels and aqueducts through the hills, often connected with the natural cave systems, all of which leaves modern Naples and the surrounding countryside riddled with underground spaces of all kinds.Following the war, the Fontanelle cult reached its height, with women caring for and conversing with the skulls, bringing flowers and offerings, and asking for wishes to be granted. Many skulls were claimed and housed in wooden niches by individuals as personal lucky charms or fonts of prophecy—the most sought after fortune telling skill being a skull with a gift for lotto numbers. The cemetery also became a popular make-out spot as well as a late night haunt for those dabbling in a bit of black magic. In an attempt to sanctify the space, a small church, Maria Santissima del Carmine, was built near the opening to the cave, but was largely ignored.All of this lasted until the Cardinal of Naples finally ordered the cemetery be closed to end the troubling obsession with lucky skulls in 1969. The cemetery has remained closed, with restoration efforts started again in 2000–2004 to again sort the remains as well as reinforce the structure of the cave.After years of being off limits, it is now open by reservation.",Skulls from the plague of 1656 and World War II bombings are united by a cult dedicated to caring for the ancient dead. ,"Catacombs of San Gennaro,Gabinetto Segreto ,Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus","Via Fontanelle, 80 Naples, 80136 Italy",40.8588,14.2391,Annetta Blackgingercinnamoncarriehudson,2015-12-31 00:00:00,"Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus,Catacombs of San Gennaro,Gabinetto Segreto ,Stazione Neapolis","Maltese Catacomb Complexes ,Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and Microminiature Museum,Motouleng Caves,Am Phu Cave",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fontanelle-cemetery-caves
542,Lock & Co. ,"world's oldest,shops",227,943,"In 1850, Edward Coke stepped inside London’s Lock & Co. haberdashery, which had already been in business for almost 200 years, and made a rather novel request.The farmer asked the hatters to devise a new kind of hat for him, one that would protect his gamekeepers’ heads from pesky overhanging branches and wouldn’t blow off at the first slight gust of wind. Lock handed the commission over to Thomas and William Bowler. A short while later, back at the shop on St. James’ Street, Coke tested out the success of the prototype by jumping on it. Luckily for the Bowlers, and the history of hats as we know it, the hat withstood his weight, Coke bought it, and sixty thousand of its kind were soon being sold each year. Established in 1676, Lock’s claims to be the oldest hat shop in the world. It still has the original cardboard pattern used to fashion Lord Admiral Nelson a cocked hat in 1800, and a ledger bearing Winston Churchill’s name. Lord Byron, Oscar Wilde, Charlie Chaplin and Clark Gable were all kitted out by the shop, which displays their framed head templates to this day.The most intriguing item is, and never was, for sale. Looking like a cross between a torture device and something stolen from the props department of a Tim Burton movie, the conformateur has been used to measure customers’ heads for over 100 years. It maps the shape of their skull by punching pins into paper and cards, making a template of the head at a reduced scale. You’d have to be mad as a hatter to use a measuring tape after seeing this contraption. ","Claiming to be the oldest hat store in the world, this historic haberdashery had a hand (and a head) in the creation of the Bowler. ","The London Library,The Embassy of the Republic of Texas,The Royal Philatelic Collection","110 Sutter Street Suite 108 London, England, SW1A 1EF",51.5054,-0.1379,Amy Lewinjooniurreley250,2014-10-20 00:00:00,"The Embassy of the Republic of Texas,The Royal Philatelic Collection,The London Library,A Geological Map of England and Wales and Part of Scotland","Sobrino de Botin,Green Thumb,Cactus Joe's Blue Diamond Nursery,Huntsman & Sons",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lock-co

In addition to its conservation work the center is also conducting research that may lead to advances in the science of prolonging life. Begun after 1966 when a group of researchers purchased a swath of Duke Forest to create an open natural habitat, the center has grown to encompass 85-acres of land on the campus. In addition to protecting the uncommon little apelets the sanctuary uses them to study both what might be common between us and them and also what is not. Lemurs are a type of prosimian (a slightly archaic classification that describes primates that seem less evolved than apes and monkeys) that can only be found on the island of Madagascar, but that is not the only thing that makes them incredibly unique. Lemurs are also the only simian that hibernates. This odd behavior and its physical benefits are the focus of recent studies at the Duke center in the hopes that we could learn to replicate the process in humans, essentially leading to dramatically longer lifespans.Visitors to the center can take a tour by appointment but be warned, the crafty little beasts have been known to escape, although none of them have made it back to Madagascar.

He finally hoofs it to his childhood home and the relative safety of his father. The real house where this scene was filmed has leaned into its cinematic legacy and become the Indiana Jones Home Bed & Breakfast.When River Phoenix (playing a young Henry Jones Jr., Indiana was the dog’s name) bursts into the small home in the film, it appears to be a simple house built by some train tracks in the arid dustbowl. Sean Connery, playing his father, Henry Jones Sr., stands as an imperious figure in a murkily lit study. As Indy approaches him to show the Coronado Cross, his dad asks the young Jones to count to 10. He does so, but in English. So his dad interrupts him and say: “In Greek.” This short scene embodies the stern, and somewhat grim household of Jones’s childhood.Today you can stay where this iconic scene was filmed. It is now a much more bright and welcoming B&B with white walls and modern fixtures. There are four units in the house, each given an Indiana Jones-ish name. There is The Holy Grail, The Crusaders, The Cortez, and The Coronado respectively. The decor is also lightly themed including a picture of Sean Connery still sitting over the hearth. On the outside of the home, the rustic mailbox bearing the Jones name is still affixed to the wooden fence, appearing exactly as it looked in the film.",The childhood home of Henry Jones Jr. is now an adventure-themed bed and breakfast. ,"Cano's Castle,Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad,Jack Dempsey Birthplace and Museum","502 Front Street Antonito, Colorado, 81120 United States",37.076,-106.0072,anastatiaanselmoportesvagabondblondejauma23Mike Portanovajamesboneillvagabondblondejjauma23nnoahlearner1aanselmoportesMMike Portanovajamesboneill,2015-07-10 00:00:00,"Cano's Castle,Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad,Jack Dempsey Birthplace and Museum,First Olympic Marathon Trials Marker","Hotel Sidi Driss,Camino Real Sumiya,Hotel Paisano,The Bonaventure Hotel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/indiana-jones-home
546,Route 66 End of the Trail Sign,"marvelous maps and measures,signs,roads,roadside attractions,monuments,architectural oddities,architecture",1583,941,"Possibly the most famous roadway in the United States, Route 66 is the stuff of legend.The popular East-to-West migration path brought people out west during the Dust Bowl era, supported economies all along its twists and turns when rough times were upon us, and 85% of the original roadway still manages to survive despite the emergence of the Interstate Highway System.Even if you’ve never had the pleasure of traveling its rambling route, you probably know the path it takes due to the popular song that lists all of its stops. But despite being able to sing a list of the cities it services, little thought is given to where it ends, as it’s so often thought to be a sunbaked desert highway.Many simply imagine it just runs right into the Pacific Ocean. And while it officially had to end at a highway intersection (originally with El Camino Real at 7th and Broadway in downtown LA and later at Lincoln and Olympic to reach Pacific Coast Highway without plunging over the edge of the Palisades), the travelers, many of whom came from far inland, kept going until they could touch the Pacific. In an effort to end the epic highway on a high note, Dan Rice of 66 to Cali (who bought the logo to raise awareness of 66 through a souvenir shirt company and had created temporary end signs several months earlier), the Route 66 Alliance and the Santa Monica Pier Restoration Corp. got together and on the 83rd anniversary of the highway’s inception, dedicated the sign to mark the long tradition of journey’s end at Santa Monica Pier.Rumors had abounded about a movie prop sign left behind decades earlier, and an image surfaced purporting to show the original placed in Palisades Park.When the pier was recognized (US Highway 66 was officially decommissioned in 1985) as journey’s end for Route 66, it only made sense for a replica of the long-missing sign to be erected  looking out over the Pacific in a symbolic display of what was the destination of so many travelers over the last century. Both sides are labeled “End” so that visitors ask “If it ends here, where does it go?”. After all, 66 today is about the journey as much as the destination. It is now believed the rumors referred to the Will Rogers Highway placard at Santa Monica and Ocean Boulevards, which was placed as part of a promotional tour for The Story of Will Rogers (1952) that ran from Chicago to Santa Monica. The image that was the source of the sign’s design is now believed to have been a photo collage of murky origin. Though it isn’t an official highway sign — you don’t want to run highway traffic into the ocean — the End of the Trail sign serves as an inspiration to thousands of visitors each year that 66 is more than a relic of what used to be; it’s a journey through the heart of the country where the meals are homemade and the neon still glows that still kicks 35 years after being officially decommissioned.  ",A sign at the end of the Santa Monica Pier marks the traditional end of the legendary American highway. ,"Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome,Pacific Park Solar Ferris Wheel,International Chess Park","9 Santa Monica Pier Santa Monica, California, 90401 United States",34.0094,-118.4973,Rachel66toCaliKerginAvoiding RegretccesareMark Caseyllindistarviraccesare666toCalipparideodiernabreaingramrrenkesslerAvoiding RegretKerginMark Casey,2010-07-25 00:00:00,"Pacific Park Solar Ferris Wheel,Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome,International Chess Park,Chez Jay","Uredd Rest Area (Ureddplassen),'Potteries and Piggeries' Bottle Kiln,LaVale Toll Gate House,Koontz Coffee Pot",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/route-66-end-trail

It’s a breathtaking work of art that took several decades to complete.The magnificent building hasn’t always rocked these extravagant gold accessories. It received its precious metal makeover in the 1700s between centuries of turbulence.During the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century, the friars fled and the convent was occupied by the invading troops. They plundered the church, taking with them some panels, and to add even further insult, used the church as a stable.Decades later, during the Portuguese Civil War, the city of Porto suffered a severe siege. The convent, occupied by the garrison that defended the city, was bombarded and suffered a serious fire. But the church was saved. It was used as warehouse near the seaport until the beginning of the 20th century.Today, the church houses a museum and still contains its prized features, including its sculpture of Jesus’ family tree.

Reasons for their rescue range from being abused at circuses or roadside zoos to being owned illegally.Many of the big cats found their way to the center when someone called the USDA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Department of Natural Resources about a cat in need, though the center has had to turn down more animals than it has been able to take in.A mix of employees, volunteers, and interns take care of the cats. Between 3,000 and 4,000 pounds of meat are fed to the cats every day, and their habitats, which can be as large as an acre and include towers and toys so the cats can play, are regularly cleaned. There is an on-site veterinary clinic for check-ups and medical procedures.Nearby universities have used the exotic feline population for research, and part of the mission of the center is to educate the public about big cats, emphasizing how dangerous they are and that, despite the temptation, they do not make good pets.","Lions and tigers and leopards, servals, pumas, bobcats, lynxes, and ocelots... oh my! ","Indiana Track & Field & Cross Country Hall of Fame Museum,Smith Memorial Labyrinth,Cataract General Store","2221 E Ashboro Rd Center Point, Indiana United States",39.3954,-87.069,TheBrevil,2017-06-26 00:00:00,"Cataract General Store,Indiana Track & Field & Cross Country Hall of Fame Museum,Smith Memorial Labyrinth,Stiffy Green","The Wild Animal Sanctuary,Zoo Miguel Álvarez del Toro,Parc des Félins,Tower of London Barbary Lion Skulls",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/exotic-feline-rescue-center-2

The discussions are usually very serious, only occasionally drifting toward the supernatural, but since no one has an absolute explanation legend tends to mix with science.One folk legend has it that two girls were playing when they were noticed by giant bears. The girls tried to run away from the bears and climbed to the top of a rock, where they prayed to be saved. The rock rose high in the air, and the girls were saved while the bears left claw marks along the side of the mountain as they tried and failed to climb after the girls.Long an inspiration and attraction for nature lovers and mountain climbers, Devils Tower was the first site to be named a National Monument in the United States.

Single women would go to doctors who would manually prompt orgasm, until the creation of the vibrator changed the female orgasm forever.In the parade of modern conveniences, first came the electric sewing machine in 1889, followed by the fan, the teakettle, the toaster—and, in 1902, the vibrator. Many came packaged in velvet-lined cases that would not look out of place in any lady’s boudoir.“All the pleasure of youth will throb within you,” read a typical ad from the era.But by the late 1920s, magazines would no longer accept advertisements for vibrators for fear of violating anti-obscenity laws, and women became reluctant to purchase them because of this newly-realized sexual stigma.For the most part, vibrator design remained unvaried, although some models added an assortment of removable tips to provide varied sensations or eschewed the handle for a more compact shape that would fit securely in a woman’s palm.By the 1950s, vibrators were often housed in hard plastic or vinyl carrying cases like portable record players of the era with scientific-looking dials and controls inside. As in the case of the fictional Rejuvenator, these Eisenhower-era vibrators were advertised as “reduction aids,” although it is unlikely that many women objected when they failed to lose weight.The Good Vibrations Antique Vibrator Museum in San Francisco displays models from these lost years. The Magnetic Massage, for example, was touted as a means to achieve a healthy complexion, lustrous hair, and a taut neck and chin.

555,Strahov Monastery ,"wonder cabinets,repositories of knowledge,sacred spaces",929,2647,"Tucked away on the top of a hill in Prague is the Strahov Monastery, the second-oldest monestary in the city.It was built in 1140 and has been rebuilt numerous times since, due to the ravages of various wars. It is likely not the monastery itself, nor its church, however, that astonishes visitors. That distinction goes to the the library within its walls.The library is divided into two major halls: the Baroque Theological Hall contains 18,000 religious texts, and the grand Philosophical Hall has over 42,000 ancient philosophical texts. The libraries hold many rare volumes, are masterfully frescoed, and contain 17th-century geographical globes.Above the shelves of the Theological Hall are gilded wooded-carved decorations with wooden cartouches. These functioned as a sort of beautiful early card catalogue system. The pictures in the wooden cartouches and their titles specified the type of literature stored on the shelves below.Of special note is the compilation wheel, used by 17th-century scribes to compile texts.

The water in the springs remains a warm 72º F, making them the perfect place for manatees to wait out the winter. The river bottom is covered in grassy kelp, a manatee’s favorite dish. Other native animals include the large mouth bass and speckled perch, as well as the odd alligator.The Springs were designated a state park in 1971. Swimming is allowed during summer, but prohibited in winter to allow the manatees space and shelter. Kayaking is allowed year-round however, and manatees, who are notoriously un-shy, are known to swim up to the boats and allow kayakers to pet them.

Complete with an array of animatronic raccoons, waterfalls, wooden bears, and moose heads, the 80-year old establishment is one of the largest public cafeteria-style eateries in the world.Clifton’s history is just as colorful as its interior. Built in 1931, the cafeteria is the sole survivor of a once larger chain of eateries owned by Clifford Clinton, who had aspirations of curing world hunger. Starting in the middle of the Great Depression, Clinton was adamant about feeding those in need and doing so in style with a cafeteria he declared “a poor man’s nightclub.” It was estimated that during a 90-day period, ten thousand people ate for free. Today this Golden Rule still holds true.Clifford and his wife sold their interests to their three children in the 1940s to turn their attention to a new project, Meals for Million. A non-profit charitable organization, Meals worked to distribute free food to starving and malnourished people all over the world.Sci-fi fans will also like to know that Clifton’s served as the meeting spot for the Los Angeles Science Fiction League in the 1930s. The Brown Room in the back was where folks like Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, Forrest Ackerman, and Ray Harryhausen would get together to discuss the future on a weekly basis.In 2015, Clifford’s wrapped up a five-year-long, $10 million renovation. Go for the food if not for the trippy atmosphere, the heart of gold attitude, or the rich history. Reminiscent of eras long past, Clifton’s still serves bowls of Jell-O, candied prunes, and a damn good banana cream pie. Update as of January 2020: Clifton’s no longer serves food. Update as of  February 2022: Clifton’s has soft-launched a reopening with a limited menu.","Giant Redwood-themed cafeteria operates under the golden rule, ""Dine Free Unless Delighted."" ","Stay On Main Hotel,Old Warner Bros.

560,Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (The Gardner),"collections,museums and collections",2583,2623,"The low-key, three-floor Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum embodies a woman who, for over three decades, assembled a collection of more than two thousand artifacts (paintings, sculptures, objects, textiles, drawings, manuscripts, photographs, letters, etc.) from around the world. Isabella’s story is intriguing, and her collection, a lifetime’s pursuit of diverse eccentricities, conveys the energy one woman found in the art of collections.The story begins when Isabella lost her first and only child to pneumonia. Soon after, she discovered she would be unable to conceive again. Traumatized by the loss of her child and the barren news, Isabella felt defeated and sank into a two-year seclusion in which she remained in her room, refusing to interact with the outside world. In the end, it was Isabella’s husband’s decision to take her on a trip across Europe that revived Isabella’s love for life, setting in motion what was to become a lifetime’s addiction.From her travels all over Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, Isabella found a new purpose: bringing back strange and beautiful objects from these foreign lands. After filling several warehouses in Boston with her new goods, she decided to build Fenway Court to house her entire collection, which she opened to the public in 1903.However, not much is known about Isabella’s private life. She burned thousands of her letters before she died, leaving very little information about her personal story. Certainly, however, an intriguing persona lay behind this collection. In 1888, it took painter John Sargent nine tries to get the portrait that Isabella wanted of herself right. She was an “energetic intellectual curiosity,” but much of what the world knew about her came from her public-facing role as a socialite and avid collector of foreign esoteric things. Her collection includes framed textiles, signed letters from celebrities, and strange artifacts such as a seventeenth century silver German ostrich. When seen as a whole, the eclectic mix portrays the interest and curiosities of a woman from the late nineteenth century with the means to follow through on her passions.Isabella Gardner is a perfect example of the difficulty in distinguishing an eccentric collector from a compulsive hoarder. Where does one draw the line? Is it a matter of taste or refinement? Quality over quantity? The ability to purchase more space so as to not wallow in what’s been amassed? Granted, most people don’t spend millions of dollars amassing treasures like Isabella, or trek the planet in search of curiosities, but we all have our quirks that hold inexplicable power to us alone.In 1990, the museum’s security guards admitted two men posing as Boston police officers who went on to steal $500 million worth of art and collectibles. With no leads decades later, the event is the largest unsolved art theft in history.Some of paintings were simply cut out of their frames. Those empty frames still hang on the wall, awaiting the return of their contents.

Just ask Mark McCloud, proprietor of the world’s largest collection of acid blotter art. McCloud recalls that he originally, “kept tabs in the freezer for a long time because I was still snarfing them, but then when I first framed them I realized that truly was the way to avoid eating them!”Enter the Institute of Illegal Images.From his home in San Francisco’s Mission District, McCloud has amassed a curio of the Acid Age that is rumored to be larger than that of the entire United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The Victorian house’s lower level is a more ‘official’ gallery of chemically inactive sheets and individual samples of acid collected from the 60’s through the “Noughties.”Famous artwork ranging from Mickey Mouse in ‘The Sorcerer’s Apprentice’ to comics by Robert Crumb have appeared on blotter sheets, but the images are used without the permission of the artists in order to protect them from being prosecuted as co-conspirators in illegal activity. McCloud also made blotter art for years, though is careful to note that he is an artist and art advocate, not a chemist.Curating this flashback incarnate hasn’t come without its share of drawbacks. McCloud has twice been brought to trial based on the Institute’s contents, and his collection has undergone inspection from the FBI. Both times, judges and officials have agreed with McCloud’s original statements: none of the sheets are dipped, it’s just a very specific genre of art!Of course, part of the potency and perceived danger of the Institute is its demonstration of just the opposite argument: in its personal and societal effects, the image cannot be separated from the hallucinogenic chemical, for the two work together to influence the experience of those partaking in LSD. This idea has provided artists a foundation from which to build the myriad of subject matter appearing on the blotters, ranging from the spiritual (Hindu gods, lotus flowers) to whimsical (cartoon characters), as well as cultural commentary (Gorbachev) and the just plain demented (Ozzy Osbourne).Whether taking a stroll down memory lane, or appreciating the ingenuity and sense of humor in each framed pane, either way McCloud’s enormous Institute of Illegal Images has a bit of good old subversive fun for everyone.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

563,Wagner Free Institute,"hunting and taxidermy,wonder cabinets,victorian,taxidermy,natural history",508,2614,"If you had an interest in science and lived in Philadelphia in the 1840s, you almost definitely knew William Wagner. You’d probably been to a few of his free informal lectures, conducted right out of his own home, illustrated with his own extensive collections. Perhaps you’d also missed a few, trying to squeeze your way into the packed room, only to find you couldn’t hear a word Wagner said.The popularity of William Wagner’s “gentleman naturalist” lectures grew so large so quickly that the noted Philadelphian merchant decided to expand into a new building - he called it the Wagner Free Institute.The beautiful Victorian building houses Wagner’s natural history collections as well as a stately lecture hall in which Wagner could continue to offer free lectures to the public. Completed in 1865, the Wagner stands as a monument to the ideal that education should be available to everyone. Wagner lectured there right up until his death in 1885.Following Wagner’s death, the famous biologist Joseph Leidy was brought on to head the institute’s research and collections. He greatly expanded the museum’s holdings and organized the entire collection according to Darwin’s theory of evolution - cases of taxidermy, entomology, and sea life were arranged from simpler to more complex organisms - which is exactly how you will find it today. The Wagner has not changed since Leidy’s rearrangement back in 1891. It is truly a museum of museums, a rare chance to see where knowledge stood during such an exciting time of scientific change. From the beautiful original rosewood glass cases, to the handwritten labels from 1865, to the case of taxonomic confusion (a platypus next to a sloth next to an anteater?), the Wagner is a treasure trove of the history of 19th century natural history.The Institute continues to provide free science and natural history classes to interested adults and children.

It performs on time, it’s flashy, it’s ancient, and it won’t cost you anything. There are a couple of real show-stoppers who go by the names of Geysir and Strokkur—one is the old pro, the other, you might say is the understudy.Geysir and Strokkur are a couple of erupting hot springs, or geysers, in the Haukadalur geothermal field, north of Iceland’s Laugarvatn Lake.The bigger of the two is Geysir (we get the English word from him, a derivative of an Old Norse word for “gush”), but he’s been a little shy about his star power recently, only spouting off sporadically. Strokkur, on the other hand, can’t contain himself, erupting reliably every 10 or 15 minutes, every day and night. There are other, smaller, geysers scattered around the field, as well as mineral springs and mud pots (a boiling slurry of geothermal water and dissolved minerals, rock and anything that happens to fall in).Although they’ve probably been active for 10,000 years or more, the hot springs of Haukadalur were first noted by Europeans back in the late 13th century, when the field erupted in geothermal activity after an earthquake. Starting in the 18th century the tourists came, looking for mineral baths, therapeutic mud, and just to watch the geysers blow.Geysir has been quiet recently, but its eruption in 2,000 of over 400 feet (122 m) holds the record for the highest known geyser blast of all time. His understudy, Strokkur, has more recently taken over the show. A little smaller, a little less experienced, but a whole lot more dependable.Visit during the winter months to catch the pale winter sun illuminating the steam shot into the air by the geysers.

The city’s then mayor Dianne Feinstein won a shriek-filled sliding competition against the district supervisor Lee Dolson, on the newly constructed Winfield Street slides.The 40-feet metal slides on Bernal Hill run alongside a section of the Esmeralda street stairs, that are a direct steep climb up to the picturesque Bernal Heights park from Esmeralda and Elsie streets. The tree-lined corridor offers progressively better views of the city as you make your way up.Like the Seward Street slides, these structures and the gardens around the stairs came up as a result of initiative taken by and cooperation of the local residents, with the assistance of the city. After a couple of decades of delighting those who knew about them, the slides were nearly dismantled in 1997-98, when expensive repairs were needed.

The carousel in Brooklyn’s 585-acre public park is one of only twelve remaining Carmel designs in existence. In amusement innovator William F. Mangel’s shop, Carmel worked side by side with a venerable who’s who of carousel artists, including M.C. Illions and Solomon & Goldstein, who designed the famous Central Park Carousel. Together, these carvers helped develop what became known as the “Coney Island style,” noted for wildly flamboyant horses, often bedecked with jewels, gold and silver leaf. Carmel was particularly fond of outfitting his carved horses with fish scale armor, wooden horseshoes, realistically imperfect teeth, lolling tongues and sweet expressions. He drew inspiration from his many visits to the Prospect Park stables, which were located just a few blocks from his Brooklyn home. The Prospect Park Carousel — a menagerie of 53 horses, two dragon chariots, a deer, a giraffe and a lion — is made with real deer antlers, which were used because they ended up being stronger than any fabricated material. The horses have real horsehair tails, a rarity, since it was common for children to yank the hair off the horse while climbing aboard, which led to an industry trend of carved or cast horse tails. Many carousels of that time included fancy chariots; the Coney Island style favored dragon motifs. Though over a century old, this is actually not Prospect Park’s first carousel. The original was erected in 1874, and was horse-powered. It was moved to the West Woods in 1885 where it burned to the ground and was replaced by a second carousel which in 1935 also burned down. Upon the creation of Prospect Park’s Children’s Corner in 1952, the current carousel was brought to the park from Coney Island. The amusement ride has seen its share of ups and downs. During the 1970s and 1980s, the carousel — like the park itself and indeed much of New York City — slowly deteriorated. It was shut down completely in 1971 and 1983 because the vendor was unable to maintain the facility.When the Prospect Park Alliance was founded in 1987 with the goal of restoring and preserving Brooklyn’s expansive park and all its features, restoring the carousel was one of the group’s first projects. Sixty new renderings of Brooklyn and Prospect Park were painted on the rounding boards, based on old photographs. Ornamented with brass and 1,000 lights, the carousel returned to its former glory.",You can still ride this 100-year-old work of art in Brooklyn's largest public park. ,"Site of the Dongan Oak,Camperdown Elm,Brooklyn-Flatbush Border Line","454 Flatbush Ave Brooklyn, New York, 11225 United States",40.6637,-73.9642,MagnumPI,2016-06-03 00:00:00,"Brooklyn-Flatbush Border Line,Site of the Dongan Oak,Camperdown Elm,Cleft Ridge Span ","Skulptur i Pilane,PlayGarden Park Sculptures ,The Virginia B.

572,The Bubble Room,"kitsch,antiquities,nostalgia,restaurants",540,942,"Ever notice how the decor in pretty much every American family-style restaurant chain tends towards “vintage” in its decor? Whether it’s an adolescent server at TGI Fridays forced to wear retro buttons, the little triangle peg game at Cracker Barrel, or just a framed picture of Jackie Robinson at the McDonald’s off Exit 278, there’s an unspoken standard that equates nostalgia with hunger. Astute visitors to Captiva Island, Florida may beg the question: “Has any restaurant ever pushed this cozy decorating concept as far as the insane extremes of The Bubble Room?” Started in 1979 in the front room of the Farqhuarson family home, the interior design began as a modest display of old children’s toys from the 1930s and 1940s like Kewpie dolls, stuffed gorillas, and vintage tin airplanes, before metastasizing into a pastel candyland of chintz and tchotchkes. The decorative concept behind the Bubble Room was, “It’s always Christmas at The Bubble Room.”  However, unless your Christmas featured a three-level train set, an endless universe of bric-a-brac, and walls covered in thousands of skewed black-and-white glossies featuring obscure celebrities (like Suzanne Heyward’s stunt double), there isn’t a square foot in the restaurant that doesn’t have a curio.The food is the apogee of comfort food. A Shirley Temple ordered there probably has little pieces of Shirley Temple in it, it’s that authentic. Then there’s the Carolina Moons, the perfect flash-fried amalgamation of cheese and bacon and fried taters that’s so comfortable, it’s like eating a couch. Of particular fame are their seven-cheese Bubble Bread and Orange Crunch Cake, a moist yellow cake layered with almond brown sugar crunch and coated in an orange cream cheese frosting.The theme of the Bubble Room isn’t Christmas, it is that you have died and now you’re with your grandparents in the afterlife.",This kitsch eatery is chock-a-block with bric-a-brac. ,"Grave of Captain Oliver Bowen,The Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum,Pistol Shrimp of Ding Darling","15001 Captiva Drive Captiva, Florida, 33924 United States",26.5223,-82.1895,Joey Freshwaterbljohnsonmandycampbell500wildcatdave67Molly McBride Jacobson,2015-10-30 00:00:00,"Grave of Captain Oliver Bowen,Pistol Shrimp of Ding Darling,The Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum,Edison & Ford Winter Estates","Lucky Rabbit,The Zenith,Turk's Inn,Pink Elephant Antique Mall",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-bubble-room-captiva-florida

And less than 10% of them have been explored.The six earthen plateaus that comprise the Etowah site were constructed in different phases down the centuries creating a sort of sedimentary deposit of cultural artifacts that show how the cultures that lived on the site grew and evolved across the ages. It is believed that the mounds were the work of a culturally advanced people (the Mississippians, despite being located in Georgia) and that their central metropolis once sat on the site. A culture of mound-builders, the people are said to have used the man-made hills both for burial purposes and as raised platforms for the homes of their elders and respected leaders.By the time the that what many consider to be traditional Native American culture dominated the land, the Mississippians had long since abandoned their city, leaving behind only remnants and mounds to tell their tale.And a surprisingly rich tale it is too. Weapons, tools, traditional dress, and a variety of domestic items have been dug out of the mounds by archeologists, and according to the state website, that is all after only around 9% of the site has been explored.

The remaining ruins date from different time periods, but all of them are impressive in their ability to last; the tower dates from the 15th century, the church from the 12th, and the transept chapels vary in age. After the Dissolution of Monasteries when the last abbot, Oliver Grace, surrendered the abbey during the reign of King Henry VIII, Jerpoint was given to the 9th Earl of Ormond and became primarily a place of interment. Among the notable carvings in the ruins are the saintly religious reliefs known as “the weepers,” and a sarcophagus that is surrounded by medieval Christian reliefs. Many of the pillars and incidental spaces in the ruined abbey are covered in similar figure carvings. The expansive cloister arcade also remains and visitors can relax among the tranquil ruins.

575,The Mysterious Witch Bonney,"catacombs and crypts,monuments,statues",191,941,"The Witch Bonney is a statue of a woman with her arms outstretched on a rectangular tomb. Her hands clutch a veil that falls down behind her body as though it were a sheet billowing in the wind. Her eyes are holes staring at the sky. Under her left eye, a black tear stains through the greening tarnish. Her dress is toga-style and its folds fall off both shoulders, exposing the upper parts of each breast. The fabric falls at an angle where one could mistake its level of exposure. The legend as told by the local high school students is that her dress gets lower and lower starting each October until, finally, her breasts are fully exposed on October 31st. However, given the Wiccans who leave offerings regularly and congregate there each Halloween, this probably would have been corroborated by witnesses. Other legends include a fellow statue as her guardian, a lion tombstone just in the line of her gaze, and also a tale of her rebirth in a tree. Groundskeepers trim all potential resurrection places nearby.The Lowell Cemetery, home to the Witch Bonney statue, is itself modeled after its more famous sister, the Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, MA. It was dedicated in 1841 and designed by George P. Worcester. Its grounds are worth a look not just because of the infamous Witch Bonney, but also because it contains a unique collection of curious gravestones as well as pleasant walking spaces. The Kerouac 5K, an annual short race in Lowell, MA, runs through the cemetery each fall.The Witch Bonney’s gravestone contradicts her own origin stories. While local storytellers explain that she was a Mill Girl employed by Lowell’s Industrial Revolution era Boott Mills, or that she was a witch who was hanged during the Salem witch trials craze, her marker indicates the names of the entire Bonney family: two women and two men, the last name, Clara Bonney, wife of Charles Bonney. Rectangles in the earth to the right of the plot are marked with all their initials. This deters neither paranormal experts who measure inexplicably high electro-magnetic fields around the statue nor the generations of teenagers frightened, and delighted, by the mysterious Witch Bonney.","The Mysterious Witch Bonney, a haunted statue in an old industrial city. ","Jack Kerouac's Grave,Jack Kerouac Park ,Jack Kerouac and William S.

577,Letchworth Village,"abandoned hospitals,abandoned insane asylums,graveyards,cemeteries,abandoned,ruins",280,941,"The hamlet of Thiells, New York, about 40 miles north of Manhattan, is a quiet, unassuming place nestled in the rolling hills of Rockland County, not far from the Hudson River. It has a peaceful, small town feel, and in 1911 it was chosen to be the home of a progressive experiment: a utopian village where the mentally ill could find calm and refuge. The institution was to take care of 2,000 patients in a complex of over 130 buildings spread over 2,000 acres – as it boasted, “an acre for every patient” – and its name was Letchworth Village.The sprawling complex was created as a home for “the segregation of the epileptic and feeble-minded.” While this archaic language makes the facility seem as though it was a sinister institution from the start, in its time it was actually seen as fairly progressive. The able-bodied tended on-site farms, there were rows of shops, a power station, sprawling grounds, and places of worship. Trying to duplicate the feel of a village with its layout of smaller, more personal dwellings in a bucolic setting, Letchworth didn’t follow the standards of the imposing asylum buildings that had previously been the institutional model. Unfortunately, despite such good intentions, Letchworth Village was almost immediately overcrowded, with the majority of its patients being children.Almost as dependable as the life cycle of a butterfly, early mental institutions like Letchworth seemed to follow a trajectory: from “noble-facility-for-healing,” to “abusive-human-rights-horror-show,” to “haunting-ruins.” And here was no exception. Contrary to its early ideals, the over-crowding led to insufficient funds and shortages in staffing, which in turn, as could often be the case, curdled into abuse. What may have been a simple design of self-sufficiency resulted in patients never having to leave, eventually calcifying Letchworth into an institution where mentally ill children were sent “up river,” and too often forgotten.The facility was up-front about its intention to use the patients as guinea pigs in clinical trials. The most famous case was the experimental polio vaccine, which was successfully tested on an eight-year-old boy in 1950. Testing was subsequently carried out in more children, and the success of the vaccine at Letchworth ushered in the widespread use that we still see today. It may also help explain why there was little outrage at the time, which may have also contributed to Letchworth being allowed to remain open for several more decades.Letchworth Village was finally closed in 1996, after years of reports of abuse, neglect and abysmal conditions. The closing came on the heels of successful human rights campaigns that had closed a number of similar facilities around the country, including the infamous Willowbrook in Staten Island as reported by Geraldo Rivera in his ground-breaking expose (which had also featured horrifying glimpses into Letchworth). The full truth of what happened inside these village buildings we’ll never know, but one thing not in doubt is in evidence about a mile from Letchworth – a small cemetery hidden in the forest off Call Hollow Road comprised of about 900 shallow graves, most of them about the size of a child. In place of names, the graves are merely numbered. Following a report in the New York Times about the graveyard, public outcry eventually led to a memorial, which lists those who are buried there under the inscription “Those who shall not be forgotten.”Like so many other closed and abandoned mental institutions, acres of the grounds at Letchworth Village have been left to simply rot and be retaken by nature, adding credence to the hoary horror movie trope of the creepy abandoned institution with the disturbing past. While some of the buildings have been repurposed, and parts of the grounds have been transformed into a golf course and public park, many of the neo-classical buildings are still left abandoned and in utter disrepair. While the once-high principals of a utopian village are slowly crumbling into ruin, it can be a peculiar sight to see groups of golfers and families walking their dogs against such a disturbing backdrop.Additional material from Luke J Spencer (Author)","Decades after testing the polio vaccine on unwitting patients, this historic mental hospital sits in ruin. ","Old Letchworth Village Cemetery,Doodletown,The House by the Railroad","Letchworth Village Thiells, New York, 10984 United States",41.2124,-74.0235,fleshxharvestMolly McBride JacobsonAngela1828th4698dkphotologyboydestructionHousatonicmerstar81TheKopasClanjmexplorations18Miscellaneous Juiceghostfilmmmkukic01dlc31723tth4698boydestructionAAngela1828ddkphotologyMolly McBride JacobsonGin Minsky,2014-11-17 00:00:00,"Old Letchworth Village Cemetery,The House by the Railroad,Doodletown,Early Electrics","Riverview Hospital,St. Bridget's Kirk,Sleight Family Graveyard,Dowles Graveyard ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/letchworth-village-2

580,Fort Matanzas National Monument,"shells,forts,military history,military,architectural oddities,architecture",1337,939,"Florida was settled much earlier by Europeans than New England and many of those settlements are still standing. Few people know that the oldest city in America is St. Augustine, which is just north of Fort Matanzas. For centuries, Florida was owned and occupied by the Spanish, French, and British before it became part of the United States. There were many confrontations between the French and the Spanish as they fought to gain control of the area. The battles were most often fought on the beaches, bays, and rivers and the Matanzas River outlet was the site of one of the bloodiest.In 1565, the French were sailing off the coast from St Augustine, cruising for a bruising, when a hurricane caught them and made mincemeat of their ships. The 127 French survivors managed to drag themselves to shore, having lost all their weapons, food, and other supplies. They made camp on the sand dunes at a river inlet.In the meantime, there were 70 Spanish troops a bit further north who had just won a battle with the French and were looking for more scores to settle. The Timucuan Indians told the Spanish about the French survivors and the Spanish troops wasted no time in marching south to go mano-a-mano once again.The French surrendered immediately when the Spanish arrived. There is some discussion as to whether or not their lives would be spared but, in the end, the Spanish slaughtered 127 and spared 16. Amazingly, the situation repeated itself just two weeks later! At that time, 134 people were killed, which adds up to 261 dead and 16 spared, for a total of 277. Due to bloody fights, the river was named “Matanzas,” which is Spanish for “slaughter” or “killings.” A totally appropriate name.Contrary to popular belief, Fort Matanzas was not there when the massacres happened. The fort was built about 175 years later. As with most of the other forts in the area, Matanzas was built from coquina, which is a soft stone that comes from the beaches. Coquina consists of crushed and broken seashells that have been compressed over a long period by the weight of the sand and water above. It is easily cut from the sand and, when laid out to air, cures to a cement-like substance.Fort Matanzas was built as a watchtower to spot enemy ships coming to attack St. Augustine. The very basic housing accommodated only seven Spanish troops. If enemy ships were seen, a messenger was sent north to St. Augustine to warn people at the much larger fort, the Castillo de San Marcos.The British, however, did take not only St. Augustine but also all of Florida by treaty in 1763. They kept Fort Matanzas as a watchtower, but by 1821, the place was in ruins. On October 24, 1924, the fort was declared a national monument, and nine years later, was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service. The fort has undergone an extensive restoration and today is a tourist attraction.Fort Matanzas is only accessible by boat since it’s on an island no larger than two acres, but the seashell fortification is well worth the trip. (The Spanish certainly thought so.)If you visit Fort Matanzas, take time to visit Washington Oaks State Park, which is a few minutes away, on the other side of the road. On the beach at Washington Oaks, you can often see huge rocks coming up out of the sand and in the breakers. These rocks are coquina stone. Sometimes the coquina stones are quite prominent and stand well above the sand. At other times, there are only a few stones to be seen, here and there. It all depends on the weather as to whether or not the stones are showing as the amount of sand on the beach varies according to the storms. Strong Nor’easters will take sand away from the beach and that’s the best time to visit.",An 18th-century Spanish watchtower made entirely of seashell and concrete. ,"The Rocks - Washington Oaks State Park,Prince Road Container House,Old Spanish Chimney & Well","8635 A1A S St. Augustine, Florida, 32080 United States",29.7174,-81.2309,acbehnkerobincutlerthemaneatingcactusRachelcheycobb,2014-01-29 00:00:00,"The Rocks - Washington Oaks State Park,Prince Road Container House,Old Spanish Chimney & Well,The Love Trees of St. Augustine","Fort Bourtange,Torre de las Cigüeñas (Tower of the Storks),Porte de Paris,Joseph Marthon Memorial Mainmast",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-matanzas-national-monument

The lounging figure stares wistfully into the distance, features forever frozen in a look of sadness, perhaps due to the constant threat of decapitation the mermaid has faced since her inception.As the piece became a popular tourist attraction, it soon became an unofficial mascot for the entire city. With this attention came a number of protests and random acts of vandalism to befall the statue. The mermaid’s head was first stolen in 1964 by political dissidents, and was never recovered. A new head was grafted onto the body, but then the statue’s arm was taken off in 1984. The arm was later recovered, but then another decapitation attempt in 1990 left a wide gash in the figure’s neck. In 1998 the head was once again stolen— but this time recovered— and finally, in 2003, the entire statue was blown off its rock with explosives. This little mermaid simply can’t seem to catch a break.Today the statue has been restored and still draws countless admirers each year. Yet it seems like only a matter of time before the mythical maid is imperiled once again.  ",The de facto symbol of Copenhagen is this bronze fairytale which cannot seem to keep its head for very long. ,"ZinkGlobal,The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid,Medical Museion","19 Langelinie Copenhagen, 2100 Denmark",55.6929,12.5992,Alexanderpandarezza1AURELIENepfromerlittlebrumbleTaterchipsdesertsky7ppandarezza1parvanAURELIENmegisasleepTTaterchipskatielou106eepfromerccygnusCollector of ExperiencesbbigkinkykittyLuis MoratohanaddmikolajunaiteJaszmina Szendreylittlebrumble,2014-08-13 00:00:00,"ZinkGlobal,The Genetically Modified Little Mermaid,Medical Museion,Geological Museum","Anna Kéthly Statue,The Goddess of Liberty,Roland M.

The mass of materials spins and sways in the wind and lights up at night, while traditional Ukranian folk music pours out of the attached speakers.Interwoven into the sculpture are reindeer, American patriotic symbolism of all kinds, oddly placed dolls, bold paint colors, trilingual press clippings and banners, wind-powered oddities, repurposed lawn ornaments, a model of Mickey Mouse in a plane, mini cars on the ground, toys galore, and painted bits of wood and steel—all of which has been gloriously wired with lights and sound.Unlike many other hermetic outsider artists, Dmytro was quite approachable and would give you a personal tour of the site for a small donation. Among the perks of the tour were seeing Dmytro turn on many of the various moving parts of the building-engulfing sculpture that aren’t usually turned on. It is a testament to Dmytro’s construction skill that the structure had survived the harsh Michigan winters so well.Known by locals as the “Hamtramck Disneyland,” the work of art doesn’t have an official name. If there is one thing everyone agrees upon, it’s that you can’t really understand the sculpture until you see it.Dmytro Szylak died May 2015 at the age of 92, locals said up until his death he was outside with his installation everyday. In March 2016, Hamtramck Non-profit Hatch Art bought the two houses connected to the Installation. They have since started restoration work and have several artists living in the units. They intend to make the unit where Dmytro resided into an International Artist Residency for artists to make community based art, having one of the sheds become a gallery space and the other a studio space.

Though it looks like a natural sinkhole lined with cascading waterfalls, Covão dos Conchos is, in fact, a wonder of engineering.This lake in the Serra da Estrela mountains was artificially created in 1955 during the construction of the nearby hydroelectric dam. Instead of building a pipeline to channel water between Lagoa Serra da Estrela and Lagoa Comprida, the engineers working on the project decided to drill a tunnel through the mountain to connect the two lakes.The spillway is designed to provide nearby communities with fresh water, but the fact that no other constructions are present nearby makes the funnel seem more like a part of the lake than a part of an infrastructure project. What’s more, there are plants growing around the edges of the concrete and granite drain pipe, making the giant hole look even more natural.

It’s the sight of oak trees blooming with beaded necklaces. They dangle from the tree limbs in all their tacky glory, colorful plastic remnants of the previous day’s festivities.Thousands of beads and other trinkets are tossed during the Mardi Gras parade, and many of the necklaces get tangled up in the branches along the route. The next morning the green trees are raining with loops of purple, gold, and green (the colors symbolizing justice, power, and faith).There is actually (and somewhat controversially) a dedicated de-beading crew that spends the days after the festival cleaning up the branches, especially when the beads present a danger to the tree. But many of these bejeweled trees will stay that way all year, until the next Carnival.Such was the case with the campus Bead Tree at Tulane University, on the Gibson Quad. Walking back to the dorms from the Mardi Gras parades, students would throw the beads they didn’t want onto the tree for good luck. If they stuck, that student would, supposedly, pass all of their classes. Sadly, the famous Tulane bead tree was cut down in June 2019 as a result of a weakening of the tree itself due to termite infestation and a lightning strike.Now as of May 2020, a metal statue mimicking the shape of a tree has been resurrected to continue the tradition.

The McGill Rose Garden began as a personal project. The land was bought in 1950 by Henry and Helen McGill, who were prominent philanthropists. Helen promptly went about building a sprawling garden here. At the time, the area was industrial—even today, the park still has a coal car parked in the corner.Helen installed over 500 rose bushes, transforming the lot into a scented oasis. In 1962, the McGills began opening their park to the public on Mother’s Day, which quickly became a favorite Charlotte-area tradition.The city purchased the property in 1976 and the McGill Rose Garden now operates as a city park with an independent board. Today, the park is over an acre large and covered in more than 1,000 rose bushes, as well as fountains, sculptures, and benches placed along its winding paths. It has been named an All-America Rose Selections public garden, making it one of the highest-quality such gardens in the United States.Until his death in 2007, visitors were likely to run into Mr. McGill among the petals and thorns. Mrs. McGill died in 1985 and her widower took on the maintenance of her beloved park with total commitment. He would work in this garden every day until he was 99.

588,Rattlesnake Bridge,"snakes,bridges,architectural oddities,animals,architecture",733,939,"Tucson, Arizona, is a city with a devotion to public art, having spent millions on various projects around the city over the past couple of decades, but possibly the most monumental of these projects is the Diamondback Bridge which was constructed in the surprisingly accurate image of a giant rattlesnake. Built in 2002, the bridge was designed by a local artist who wanted to incorporate the local wildlife into his city project. The bridge, while abstract, is also quite biologically accurate. On one end the entrance to the bridge is shaped like the snake’s gaping maw, the long fangs presented as support beams below sinister reptilian eyes. The bridge itself is covered by a metal mesh which forms the snake’s body which is painted in the exact hues and gradient of a real rattlesnake. In addition, cars passing beneath the span can see the accurately spaced segments of the beast displayed on the belly. Coming out the… other… end of the snake, there is a tall statue shaped like a tail rattle that juts 30 feet out of the ground, also sculpted and painted biologically correct.  Finally (as if this particular serpentine lily needed any gilding), if you walk in just the right place when exiting the bridge, you’ll receive a loud and startling “goodbye” rattle from hidden speakers.When the bridge was first built it was met with a certain amount of backlash from locals who felt it was garish and cheesy, but the artist’s vision won out and the bridge remains to this day. Unfortunately, the maintenance budget for the bridge is not quite what it should be and the snake looks like it may need to grow a new skin, peeling paint and cracked concrete signaling its age. Regardless of its wear, though, there is still something novel about strolling cavalierly into the belly of a metal monster.",In Tucson a giant metal snake helps pedestrians cross a busy highway. ,"John Dillinger Courtroom,University of Arizona Mathematical Models Collection,Hotel Congress","Broadway & Euclid Tucson, Arizona, 85719 United States",32.2212,-110.9613,EricGrundhauserCorpseLady84TaterchipsYsabetcaseyjacksKencho,2014-12-08 00:00:00,"Hotel Congress,John Dillinger Courtroom,University of Arizona Mathematical Models Collection,El Charro Cafe","Overtoun Bridge ,Thread City Crossing Bridge,Dobwalls Bypass Bat Bridge ,Nutty Narrows Bridge",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/diamondback-bridge

592,Darth Vader Grotesque,"gargoyles,outsider architecture,sacred spaces,architectural oddities,architecture",869,939,"Cathedrals are well known as places of quiet reflection and reverence for divinity. To encourage these behaviors, architects often use calm, echoless corridors, vaulted ceilings arching toward the heavens, awe-inspiring architecture, and carvings of beloved science fiction characters. That last one isn’t exactly common, but it’s definitely the case at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.The sixth-largest cathedral in the world, this stunning Neo-Gothic construction is a functioning place of worship as well as a popular tourist destination. Nearly half a million people enter through its doors each year, many of them just to admire its breathtaking beauty. It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the cathedral offer a bit of tongue-in-cheek eye candy for the dedicated architecture enthusiast — a well-hidden, but very official, carving of Star Wars villain Darth Vader perched high among its many spires.Unsuspecting onlookers should take heed – this is no optical illusion. During the 1980s an outer portion of the National Cathedral was under construction, and a contest was held for schoolchildren to design a sculpture to be added to the towers being renovated. A child by the name of Christopher Rader drew the Vader sculpture, and it was selected for the third place prize, which included addition in the renovation.The sculpture, carved by Patrick J. Plunkett, is often referred to as a “gargoyle,” the most famous of creature-inspired architecture, however this is technically incorrect. A gargoyle refers to a sculpture out of which water is drained from the building. The Darth Vader statue does not drain water, and thus is technically a grotesque.To see the sculpture, binoculars or a high-powered zoom lens are recommended to see the intricacies of the high roof. From the northwest parking lot, near the top of the northwest tower, Darth Vader can be spotted between two massive arches. The bust will be to the upper left of a closer, larger skull-shaped grotesque.While this addition may seem strikingly irreverent, thousands of curious travelers stop by the cathedral simply to search for this hidden treasure. If one of the primary goals of a cathedral is to attract non-parishioners and appeal to the unconverted, this winking reference to popular culture isn’t a bad first step along that journey.",The sci-fi villain is a little-known inhabitant of the U.S. capital's largest cathedral. ,"Space Window at the Washington National Cathedral,National Cathedral Bell Tower,FBI Spy House","3101 Wisconsin Avenue Northwest Washington, D.C., 20016 United States",38.9304,-77.0716,Mark CaseySeth TeichersemkenRachelMartinLeslie McIntyre,2012-03-28 00:00:00,"National Cathedral Bell Tower,Space Window at the Washington National Cathedral,FBI Spy House,USNO Master Clock","'Alien' Gargoyle,Saint Michael and All Angels Church,The Bull of Santa Maria del Fiore,The Vampire Rabbit of Newcastle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/darth-vader-grotesque

At the Italian Mediterranean’s magical Spiaggia Rosa (Pink Beach), a unique melange of marine matter gives the sand a peculiar pink pigment.Spiaggia Rosa is one of the few places on the planet to have pink sand. As a result, it’s one of the most unique and paradisiacal spots on the Italian Mediterranean. The brilliant color of Spiaggia Rosa comes from a concoction of crushed fossils, crystals, coral, and dead marine creatures, which blend together to tint the sand with a rosy blush. In the past, the beach at Budelli was a lot more pink. But decades ago, when tourism to Budelli began to surge, visitors began to steal the pink sand to sell it elsewhere or keep it as a souvenir. This depleted the amount of pink sand on the beach, and as a result, the Italian government made it illegal for any tourists to set foot on the beach in 1994 to preserve the beach’s brilliant hue.During the summer, visitors are allowed to take day trips to the island as long as they stay off Spiaggia Rosa. They can look, but not touch, the beautiful sand.When it comes to protecting the pink sand of Budelli, the Italian government doesn’t mess around. When New Zealand banker Michael Harte attempted to establish an eco-friendly resort and biological observatory on the island in 2013, the Italian government responded by blocking his proposal in an effort to preserve the environment.

Though the trailers and cages have sat abandoned for decades, they still remain and speak to a time when local residents could catch glimpses of elephants grazing just off the road.Known locally as Gandini’s Circus, the relationship between the ruins and that particular circus are unclear. Urban legend says Gandini’s began in the early 1900s and folded during the Great Depression. In 1943, a man named Howard Suesz bought the remaining assets of Gandini’s Circus and used them to start the Clyde Bros. Circus, an indoor circus that performed in stadiums and arenas and did a lot of work for the Shriners. In 1949 Suesz created the Hagen Bros. Circus, an outdoor counterpart to Clyde Bros. that was a more traditional tent show. Both Clyde Bros. and Hagen Bros. used the property in Edmond as a winter camp. Research by a local historian could not find any evidence of the existence of a Gandini’s Circus. Whatever the origin, the name stuck.The winter camp served mainly as a seasonal home for the circus animals as well as the employees associated with their care. This included elephants, lions, tigers, chimps, ponies, llamas, bears, snakes, and trained coyotes. The property contained houses for the animal trainers and their families, heated barns with circus rings for sheltering and training the animals, a large cleared field for grazing, and plenty of space for storing branded trailers, trucks, buses, and snake houses during the off season.Suesz sold his circuses to Carden & Johnson International Circus in 1976, and as a result the winter camp was moved to a new location and much of the Hagen Bros. and Clyde Bros. equipment was left to deteriorate. Ownership of the land passed to Jose Barreda, Suesz’s lion tamer who had lived with his wife and sons on that little slice of circus on the outskirts of Oklahoma City. However, with no circus to house or animals to look after, the lot has sat empty and all but abandoned for decades.Beyond the barren field of patchy grass and concrete slabs lie the only reminders of the circus that was. Visible from the front entrance is a ramshackle house that was once home to circus employees. Behind that, a few derelict trailers and the hollow skeleton of a bus. Further in the brush are the leftovers of a warehouse. Animal cages and train cars litter the western end. Surprisingly, someone mows the field regularly.Jose Barreda eventually passed down the property to his son, Jorge, who retains the property in absentia and continues the family business in Florida to this very day.",Tucked away on an empty wooded lot in suburban Oklahoma City lie the remnants of an abandoned circus camp. ,"Hopewell Baptist Church,Rodeo Animal Cemetery,National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum","N Kelly Avenue between Swan Lake Road and Pruett Drive Edmond, Oklahoma, 73003 United States",35.6591,-97.4979,WeifinderRandiNicoleerjefferyetaylor5842TonboMediaRHyzereetaylor5842RandiNicoleTonboMediaerjefferyS2RHyzer,2016-05-04 00:00:00,"Hopewell Baptist Church,National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum,Rodeo Animal Cemetery,The American Pigeon Museum ","Old Headquarters Historic Monument ,Grave of Charles Stratton,Jekyll Island Amphitheater ,Kiosk Ghost Town",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gandinis-circus

It began as a collection of plants donated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a small group of California gardens, in addition to the native species that grew onsite, such as willow trees and coastal scrub. Within two decades, the garden boasted around 1,500 plant varieties, and that number more than doubled between the 1950s and ’70s when the garden gained traction for its special collection of Eucalyptus and Ficus plants. The botanical garden became an important site for horticultural research and experimentation in the subtropical tree arena, and the UCLA campus cultivated an impressive arboretum. Today, the 7.5-acre garden is an educational resource, a research site, and a “living museum” that exhibits some 3,500 species plant varieties from across the globe. The plant collections are organized thematically and geographically, and include Ancient Conifers, Bromeliads, Cycads, Mediterranean Ecosystems, and Southern California Natives, among others. The garden was named Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden in 1979, after the pioneering American horticulturist who helmed the garden for 18 years.

This sliver of central Arizona offers an exceptional example of prehistoric cliff dwellings built by members of the Salado culture.A moderate 1.5-mile hike through the basin brings you to the Upper Cliff Dwelling, which features 40 rooms and boasts panoramic views of the Tonto Basin and Theodore Roosevelt Lake. The dwelling is built into a large, shallow cave near the crest of the mountain.This enormous architectural marvel was built in 1300 CE, with construction continuing until its residents abandoned the area sometime between 1400 and 1450 CE. While exploring the cave, you’ll find partially intact roofs, old door lintels, and even rooms that once stood three stories tall.You can’t explore this dwelling on your own, though. Access is only via guided tours offered through the National Park Service.If you can’t snag a spot on an Upper Cliff Dwelling tour, you can still check out another cliff dwelling within the national monument. The Lower Cliff Dwelling doesn’t require a tour to visit, allowing you to view its 20 rooms at your own pace.

597,TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport,"modernism,airports,places to stay,hotels,design,history,architecture",386,936,"Those flying through JetBlue’s Terminal 5 at JFK Airport will look out the window and see a magnificent white shell, a grandiose design likened to a “concrete bird.” But upon further investigation, the beautiful work of architecture is entirely devoid of airplanes, and it’s completely empty inside save a handful of construction vehicles.The abandoned Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight Center, designed by Eero Saarinen and built in 1962 at JFK Airport (then Idlewild Airport), was designed to be the next big thing in the elegance of air travel. Known as the “Grand Central of the Jet Age,” the historic terminal was futuristic and cutting edge, featuring an elevated footbridge, old clocks hung from the ceiling, large windows, and a classy collection of red velvet lounge chairs. The departure/arrival corridor looked like it came straight out of James Bond, a red carpet piercing through a white tube.The terminal was an aesthetic and commercial success for decades, until the early 2000s, when TWA was sold to American Airlines and the terminal’s retro layout was deemed insufficient for 21st century security guidelines. The duties of the TWA Flight Center were transferred to the modern day Terminal 5, located just to the east of the now-empty building. Thanks to its placement on the National Register of Historic Places, the midcentury flight center was preserved, sitting unoccupied in the center of one of America’s busiest airports. It remained in limbo for years—intact, but entirely empty other than the occasional open house.By 2015—nearly 14 years after its closure—the TWA terminal finally found a new purpose. In 2019, the original head house opened as an airport hotel, consisting of 505 new guest rooms while maintaining many of the airport’s original icons, including the Lisbon Lounge and the Paris Café. The flight center’s exciting repurposing reminds us that it’s never too late or too costly to preserve history.",This futuristic airport terminal was abandoned for decades before reopening as a hotel—with a vintage plane of its own parked out back. ,"Luna de Xelajú,Valencia Movie House,Greaser on a Clock","TWA Center JFK Airport Queens, New York",40.6458,-73.7776,lewblankAvoiding RegretMtnLadyLiamYcavok86tomtallericoLLiamYMMtnLadyttomtallericommarzon67Collector of ExperienceszwfineartSEANETTAcavok86Avoiding Regret,2017-05-12 00:00:00,"Greaser on a Clock,Valencia Movie House,Luna de Xelajú,Bayside Cemetery","Gander International Airport Lounge,Gearrannan Blackhouse Village,IG Farben Haus,Kruisherenhotel ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jfk-twa-flight-center
598,Aerojet Dade Rocket Facility,"nasa,space exploration,abandoned",159,936,"The government and its contractors have a long tradition of abandoning facilities that no longer serve them, but generally the sites are cleaned of anything of interest leaving starkly empty buildings to rot.However at the Aerojet-Dade Rocket Facility, they decided to just leave their giant rocket where it was. Located in the middle of 25,000 acres of land purchased by the Aerojet company in the early 1960’s, the test site was developed to experiment with various types of rocket fuel with which to get humans into space. Two rocket silos were built into the ground and during its operating life, the complex tested three different rocket types at full-burn. These static tests gauged the effectiveness of solid rocket fuel, the last test rocket being the largest solid-fuel rocket ever built. This last test saw the release of hydrochloric acids across the surrounding crops and wetlands, making the facility less than popular among the locals.In addition to the primary structures and the silos, Aerojet-General also created the largest and longest canal found anywhere in the Everglades. The canal, which reaches the Atlantic Ocean after traveling underneath a drawbridge created for it on the way, was required to transfer the incredibly heavy rockets by barge. Because they were designed as solid-fuel and weighed an unbelievable amount, no other method of transportation would suffice.Unfortunately for Aerojet, NASA chose to use liquid fuel for its manned launches and the Dade testing facility was scrapped when the contractor’s funding dried up. The silos and buildings were quickly abandoned and while attempts were made to use the surrounding land for farming and redevelopment, nothing ever took.The final SL-3 rocket was left in its silo and imperfectly covered with steel plates, making it, along with the other remaining sheds, a magnet for urban explorers. Recently, a number of the structures have been dismantled and the silos covered with huge cement beams, making the site more impenetrable for explorers. Aerojet Dade Rocket Facility is quickly being buried, creating another relic in what will one day be known as the archaeology of space travel.              ","When this test site was abandoned, they didn't even bother to take the rocket with them. ","Ed Leedskalnin's Coral Castle,Fruit and Spice Park,Robert Is Here","Extreme south end of SW 232nd Ave Homestead, Florida, 33034 United States",25.3214,-80.5577,EricGrundhausermistrwrongMolly McBride JacobsonlaurennashRachelsriggs,2013-11-11 00:00:00,"Robert Is Here,Ed Leedskalnin's Coral Castle,Fruit and Spice Park,Underwater Hotel in Key Largo","Hidden Figures Way,Prairie Observatory,Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex,Plum Brook Station (Neil A.

An area rich in gold, silver, copper and lead, the land was mostly settled by Civil War deserters, and was the site of one of the largest booms the state of Nevada ever encountered.The mine was understandably in high demand, and labor disputes and ownership disagreements were common; so often ending in bloodshed that murder became commonplace, and even expected. The sinister reputation of the town and its riches that were so often paid for in blood didn’t deter fortune seekers, but Nelson was unfortunately directly downstream of El Dorado Canyon, and flash flooding made the boomtown, once stripped of its precious minerals, practically uninhabitable.What remains of Nelson lies above the flood channels, a few scattered ranch houses, the remnants of a Texaco station, and the standard weather-torn buildings and machinery. Used as the location for many photo shoots, music videos and several feature films, the site features one unusual spectacle of a small aircraft seemingly smashed nose-first into a dune.

The two teenagers would have been used to the sway of the wooden walkway, but this time the planks gave out from under them. In a flash they were at the bottom, miraculously unscathed, still standing upright.It may have been just a stroke of good luck, or maybe someone was watching over them. After all, the Swinging Bridge—also called Lovers Leap here in Columbus Junction—comes complete with a legend of lost love, and even the occasional haunting.The bridge goes back long before the Tisor brothers made their crossing. The original one, made from salvaged barrel wood, dates from either 1880 or 1886 (accounts differ) and was built to provide a direct route from Fourth Street to Third without having to walk all the way around the 80-foot ravine.That one lasted until 1902 when its haphazard construction was condemned by the city. In 1904, bridge number two went up, and it stayed up for sixteen years until it tumbled down under the Tisor brothers’ feet. Two years after that it was bridge number three, and with a few updates and overhauls over the decades, it’s been up ever since.No one really knows how the ravine came to be known as Lovers Leap, but the most often told tale is of a love-sick maiden, her lover killed in battle, threw herself to the bottom to end her grief. Or maybe it was a case of unrequited love—that story has some traction too. It’s said that the maiden is buried at the bottom, and if you cross over at night you can hear her mournful cries. Maybe it was her watching over the Tisor boys back in 1920.",A warning to the weak-kneed: This narrow bridge does its swinging eight stories high. ,"'Sitting Man',Captain James T.

It is a local fixture, visible right from across the river from the National University of Ireland, Galway. Yet this mysterious abandoned castle is so thoroughly overgrown with vegetation it is almost disappearing into the scenery. The 16th-century castle was the home of the Blake family, English nobles that inhabited the Menlo estate (also called Blake Castle) from 1569 up until a fire destroyed the castle in 1910, tragically taking the life of the Blake’s disabled daughter, Eleanor, whose body was never found.The riverside path alongside the empty castle is a quiet and unassuming spot, populated by just a few local dog walkers or joggers from the university. The green vegetation that blankets the castle makes it difficult to spot, as it blends in with its natural surroundings. But continue along and you’ll come upon the ruins of a small stone hut, which help to reveal that the castle will soon come into view.When you get close enough, the large round towers distinguish the castle from the surrounding trees, and once you get a direct line of sight, the exposed stone toward the base reveals the extent of the structure. Green hanging vines cover nearly the entire stone exterior, indicating just how long the castle has been deserted and reclaimed by the natural landscape. Update February 2022: The ivy on the castle has unfortunately been cut down, and a construction site fence has been erected around the castle, blocking access to the ruins.",A moody and picturesque riverside ruin overgrown with vegetation. ,"The Calendar Sundial,Áras na nGael,Fishery Watchtower Museum","Galway Ireland 53.2966, -9.0733Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyÁras na nGael1.90 milesFishery Watchtower Museum1.97 milesThe Calendar Sundial8.40 miles",53.2966,-9.0733,phawk54WeirdTravelerBr33zyAndreas23058Collector of ExperiencesAnna Zielinska,2018-10-10 00:00:00,"Áras na nGael,Fishery Watchtower Museum,The Calendar Sundial,Brigit's Celtic Garden","Van Slyke Castle Ruins,Sanquhar Castle,Newman's Nursery Ruins,Whorlton Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-menlo-castle

Beginning with a donation to the academy in 1847, the collection has grown over the years thanks almost entirely to donations and some prizes purchased specifically for the library. Most of the items in the sprawling catalogue date from between the 15th and 18th centuries, including almost every single piece of medical writing printed in North America during the 1700s. Among the rich leather volumes and brittle pamphlets are rare works by Sigmund Freud, historic works on disease and obstetrics, and famously, a pair of prototype dentures made of real teeth that were the model for George Washington’s replacement chompers.Thanks to the preservation and conservation efforts of the academy staff, the aging books and papers are kept in terrific condition, even in spite of the inexorable frailties that time constantly imposes on the works. In fact, one of the major efforts of the library today is to get as many of the items digitized as they can before they are lost to time and deterioration.       Anyone interested in the odd history of bodily discovery and treatment, or just stunning collections of old tomes, need only make an appointment to see one of the most impressive hidden libraries in the city. ",This hidden library of physiological ephemera contains centuries worth of knowledge on the vim and viscera of the human body. ,"Graffiti Hall of Fame,Blockhouse No. 1,The Manhattan Eruv","1216 5th Avenue New York, New York, 10029 United States",40.7923,-73.9524,EricGrundhauservictoriyahappyMartin,2015-01-29 00:00:00,"Graffiti Hall of Fame,Blockhouse No. 1,The Manhattan Eruv,New York Cancer Hospital","Secret Apartment in the Fort Washington Library ,The Waring Historical Library,Osler Library of the History of Medicine,Defense Intelligence Agency Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-academy-of-medicine-rare-book-library

But the playful statues belie the artist’s past as a controversial and violent performance artist.Designed by artist Tom Otterness, the miniature cartoon-like statues depict the real and imagined details of life and history in hectic New York City. In the most notable, a sewer alligator chomps on the behind of a money bag-headed miniature while another well-dressed man, perhaps based loosely on 19th century political machine leader Boss Tweed, looks on.Cute and playful with political undertones, each of the more than 100 bronze statues represent the tiny details, history, and myths of New York City, a place so chaotic that many of its residents miss out on the little things such as these. Constructed as part of a multi-million dollar subway renovation project in 2001, the clever bronze works have been widely overshadowed by Tom Otterness’ past work, a film entitled “Shot Dog Film,” in which Otterness shoots and kills a dog.Filmed in 1977,  Otterness has publicaly apologized for the violent, looped film, saying “Thirty years ago when I was 25 years old, I made a film in which I shot a dog. It was an indefensible act that I am deeply sorry for. Many of us have experienced profound emotional turmoil and despair. Few have made the mistake I made.

The beginnings of the current mine are believed to have been primitively excavated after the discovery of a rock salt deposit in ancient times. In the middle ages, salt became recognized as one of the most important staples in the food and preservation industry, leading to the advancement of salt mining technology and further excavation. During the Renaissance, the mine was one of the largest business ventures in Europe. It was around this time that royal tourists started to flock to the mine, lured there in part by the developing Renaissance taste for humanism and culture.By the late 18th century, Austria gained control of the mine and brought new forms of organization, as well as further technological advancement - many of which are responsible for the longevity of the mine. The birth of general tourism in the mine occurred during Austrian rule. In the early 1990s, the production of salt in the mine ceased, and after the mine flooded, the importance of preservation was reestablished.Despite the mine’s remarkable history, it is the miner artwork (and later artwork by others) that brings over a million tourists to the Wieliczka Salt Mine each year. The miners slowly turned the mine from a dark cave into a majestic royal location. By the 19th century, giant salt-crystal chandeliers lighted the underground complex. Striking salt-carved monuments and reliefs decorated chambers available to tourists, resulting in Europe-wide fame. In the early 1900s, the Kinga Chapel was formed, a chamber filled with large biblical reliefs.

610,Billingsgate Roman House and Baths,"bath house,subterranean,underground,roman,subterranean sites",135,933,"In 1848, workers constructing the new Coal Exchange in the City of London unearthed one of the best examples of Roman buildings found in the capital. Realizing the importance of what they had discovered, the Victorian Londoners preserved the remains in the cellar of the building. When the Coal Exchange was eventually demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a new building, further excavations were carried out, and the ruins were once more incorporated into a cellar.Excavations determined that the Roman house was built in the late second century, and would once have looked out onto the Thames, the river back then being much wider than it is today. However, this pleasant view was eventually spoiled when riverside walls were constructed, and the house and its large courtyard were thus plunged into the shade for much of the day.There is speculation that the bathhouse was erected to make use of the land after it lost its vista of the river. The baths would have been open to the public, though they were more like a modern-day spa or sauna than the pools of water their name suggests.From the heat of a furnace, hot air would circulate through a hypocaust, heating a warm room, (tepidarium) and a hot room (caldarium). It’s likely the patrons used these rooms first, where they’d work up a sweat, massage themselves with olive oil, and then have their body hair plucked. After all this, they would enter the cold room (frigidarium), where the chill and water from a small cistern would help close their pores.Soon after the withdrawal of the Romans in the early fifth century, their city of Londinium collapsed, with many of its buildings then decaying into piles of overgrown rubble. The Saxons would later build on top of these, only for their buildings to fall, and this cycle of building on the ruins followed by collapse would continue for around a thousand years. In this way, being deep beneath the ruins of several epochs of London’s inhabitants, the Roman baths and house survived both the Great Fire and the Blitz.",A Roman spa buried deep beneath the City of London. ,"The Ruins of St. Dunstan-in-the-East,Pudding Lane,Philpot Lane Mice Sculpture","101 Lower Thames St London, England United Kingdom",51.5093,-0.0831,AmunyAnkhesenramathify,2018-10-23 00:00:00,"The Ruins of St. Dunstan-in-the-East,Philpot Lane Mice Sculpture,Pudding Lane,Monument to the Great Fire of London","Roman Cisterns of Fermo,Naples Underground,Sewers of Barcelona,Pozzo della Cava",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/billingsgate-roman-house-and-baths

Fossilized stumps of a redwood forest litter the site, which is the most prolific source of fossilized insects anywhere in the world.Located in a mountain valley and operated by the National Park Service, Florissant Fossil is a popular tourist destination because of its exhaustive record of a particular kind of prehistoric life.The visitors center is filled with fossilized insects on display, complete with background and scientific information. A 14-minute film shown in the center is recommended. It explains that the fossils are contained in the Florissant Formation of Eocene age. Almost 35 million years ago, volcanic eruptions buried the lush valley that was once in this area. Ash petrified the redwood trees — some up to 14 feet wide — that grew here and a lake formed that became a resting place for thousands of plants and insects.The Florissant Fossil Beds were set aside as part of the National Park System in 1969.

About 100 years ago, throngs of workers would come back home to the city’s center for a drink and conversation after spending long hours outside. And one of the favorite spots for get-togethers a century ago still exists downtown: the Arctic Club.In 1916, the Arctic Building, as it was known then, opened for business. And ever since, the nine-story structure on 3rd Avenue and Cherry has remained one of the Emerald City’s most cherished gems. The splendid terra cotta exterior is rich with detail, including a wonderful, elaborate walrus carving hanging in the walkway above the front door. The entrance opens up into a grand hallway lined with black-and-white photos of past club members along its entry walls.If you go a little further into the hull of the hotel, you’ll find the Polar Bar, which has been fostering conversation for the past century. This is the room where ship captains, traders, gold miners, local heavyweights and the like got together to do business and imbibe. And, today, the room maintains that same air. The cozy interior combined with the historic dark oak bar and fireplace make the lounge inside feel almost like a portal into a bygone era before internet and TV screens.But the most spectacular sight is on the second floor. Proceed up the stairs from the lobby, walk down a corridor, and you’ll soon come to the Northern Lights ball room. Over this event space is a beautiful leaded-glass dome, about 60 feet in diameter, complete with a chandelier at the center. The dome room, often used for weddings, was also featured in the climactic scenes of Stephen King’s “Rose Red” TV mini-series.Despite everything changing around it, the Arctic Club has maintained its original aesthetic even after modest renovations by the DoubleTree Hotels, which now owns and operates the building. And folks still often wander in to take a seat at the bar, flanked by the room’s mascot—a giant white replica polar bear—to have a stiff drink or satisfying meal. Update as of May 2022: The Arctic Club is closed indefinitely.   ","The historic bar where local ship captains, traders, and gold miners would come together to do business a century ago. ","The Red Hall at Seattle's Central Library,Smith Tower Penthouse,Steve's Weird House","700 3rd Avenue Seattle, Washington United States",47.6039,-122.3318,Jake UittiAty Trociousbrifer22matthucke,2018-05-18 00:00:00,"Steve's Weird House,Smith Tower Penthouse,The Red Hall at Seattle's Central Library,Seattle Underground ","Chowning’s Tavern,El Batey,Café Lafitte in Exile,Under-the-Hill Saloon",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-arctic-club-seattle-washington

The birthplace of Rick James and Buffalo wings has plenty of galleries and restaurants and a booming public art scene. And when asked for recommendations, locals often insist on getting a picture with Shark Girl.According to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, which bought the piece for an undisclosed sum, “Shark Girl is the absurd, hilarious, and bittersweet creation of artist Casey Riordan Millard.” Millard has been painting Shark Girl, who’s been featured in almost all of her work, since 2004.The statue is a “fish out of water” and symbolizes a desire for normalcy. It’s Millard’s first public sculpture, funded by a $6,000 grant through Cincinnati’s Arts Ambassador Fellowship in 2013. Shark Girl spent a few years posing for photos on the Ohio River, before making her way to Buffalo in August 2014. The sculpture was refurbished in 2015 and placed in Canalside, a historic district and once the western terminus of the Erie Canal.Shark Girl is now a social media star, and Millard has gained a bigger audience to boot.

Originally it was intended to be an open plan zoological attraction designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who had also designed the surrounding park. When it opened the free zoo was a runaway hit (with thankfully no runaway animals), drawing millions of people a year. Unfortunately, the good times didn’t last and by the 1930s the wild zoo fell into decline. In 1958, the zoo was taken over by a commission with the city which set out to revitalize the historic menagerie. First order of business was to build a fence around the perimeter of the zoo and begin charging admission. In addition, a more professional staff was hired and the zoo was brought into the modern age. Well, most of it. Some of the older structures, like the original bear pens (and a badger enclosure) were simply left outside of the fence to rot. Even a plan to tear them down made around the time of the new millennium seems to have been left to collect entropy, so there they sit to this day.The old metal and stone structures seem a bit dangerous now that they are crumbling and covered in rust.

617,Warm Springs Pools ,"hot springs,preservation,native americans,water",171,931,"When it was built in 1761, Warm Springs Pools was a “gentlemen’s” bathhouse, uniquely built in an octagonal shape with a large hole in the roof to let the steam out. The women’s bathhouse next door came several decades later in the same fashion. Today, the original structures still stand, beautiful yet in a sad state of advanced decay.The bathhouses were built over the year-round 98-degree natural pools in the aptly named Warm Springs, Virginia. The waters flow at a rate of 1,700,000 gallons per day.These magnificent crystal springs were discovered centuries ago by Native Americans journeying through the valley. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans have been in the area for at least 9,000 years. According to Native American stories, people were instantly rejuvenated after bathing in the warm waters of the spring, and it was considered a sacred place. Soon after, spa houses began being built throughout the 16th century following the European style. These spa houses become even more popular in the following century in places where wealthy southerners would “take the waters” for relaxation.But it was the healing promises of the mineral-rich waters that brought Thomas Jefferson to the pools, where he soaked daily for three weeks to try and help his rheumatism. It’s ironic that the pools were named after him, though, as local historians claimed he found the spa quite boring.Boring or not, the Warm Springs Pools are still flowing today. The original wood structure of the bathhouses has fallen victim to the elements for over the last 250 years, however, and the physical surroundings are in quite obvious decline. But an organization is working to preserve this rotting wonder, so guests can bathe in the warm springs just as Thomas Jefferson did decades ago.Update: As of December 2021, The Jefferson Pools are temporarily closed for restoration.

618,Jack Daniel's Distillery Tour,museums and collections,851,934,"In 1875, a man named Jack Daniel decided to get into the booze business. The adopted son of a moonshine distiller in Tennessee, Daniel excelled at his craft. At the 1904 St. Louis World Fair his sour mash Tennessee whiskey won a gold medal, but the temperance movement was hot on his his heels. Daniel retired in 1907 and gave the distillery to his nephews to run, but a mere three years later, Tennessee passed the prohibition law and they had to stop production. Although distilling was relocated to more hootch-friendly Missouri and Alabama locations, they struggled with quality control—bourbon just wasn’t as good as it was when it came from Tennessee. It wasn’t until 1938 that the law was repealed and the red tape was cleared so that the party could start once again, but then WWII came around, ruining everything and shutting down the distillery once more for 5 years.The smoke cleared and business started back up in 1947, and since then the company and its famous whiskey have been chugging along fine. One of the most recognized names in the world of drinkers, they offer several variations of the mash liquor, and their brand name and logo can be seen just about everywhere there are serious cocktail happenings. The distillery has been on the National Register of Historic Places since the early 70s, and offers a tour of the facilities to their adoring public—however whiskey drinkers may find this educational jaunt through the history of Jack Daniel’s a tad disappointing…The famous distillery is located in Lynchburg, which is in Moore County … which has been a dry county since 1872. However, they did find loopholes in the local law. On the drinking tours, workers are allowed to serve alcohol as part of a “celebration.” There’s also an alcohol shop onsite called the “White Rabbit,” where rare special editions and commemorative bottles are allowed to be sold in the dry county since you can’t buy them anywhere else. This is one of only two locations in the county where you can buy alcohol, as the other is an unaffiliated wine store in their downtown, which falls under agricultural law. The tour offers a comprehensive history of Jack and the business, and explains the process of whiskey production. For a small fee, you can also do three small tastings, in this otherwise dry county.","All you ever needed or wanted to know about America's favorite whiskey, but not a drop to drink. ","The Templeton Library,Old Stone Fort,Sewanee Natural Bridge","280 Lynchburg Highway Lynchburg, Tennessee, 37352 United States",35.2853,-86.3683,markswhelancait7911Robert RoseFerfRacheldcardelinoddcardelinoccait7911RRobert RoseFFerfRachellittlebrumble,2013-01-26 00:00:00,"Old Stone Fort,The Templeton Library,Sewanee Natural Bridge,High Point Restaurant (RyeMabee Mansion) ","The Insect Asylum ,Museo de Ropa Étnica de México (Mexican Ethnic Clothing Museum),War Museum Askifou,Caballero No. 1",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jack-daniel-s-distillery-tour

During the Cold War it was the site of several acts of anti-Castro terrorism. With the recent easing of tensions, a new mixological addition has accompanied the restored diplomatic relationship.The Embassy has continued to reflect the tone of U.S.-Cuban relations. As tensions between the two countries thawed in 2011, the embassy offered up some “Daiquiri Diplomacy” and opened an exclusive bar on the top floor dedicated to Ernest Hemingway.Hemingway, revered in both countries, once lived in Cuba and had a good relationship with Fidel Castro. In an interview with CNN, Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas described how as a child, “when we learn English in Cuba, we learn it through what [Hemingway] wrote, his pieces of literature.” The gesture was a peace offering of friendship.The Hemingway bar has terracotta floors, traditional wooden fans, and is lined with photographs of the famous author. When it opened during the final years of the embargo, all the drinks and cigars were free because money couldn’t change hands between Americans and Cubans. Unfortunately, the bar isn’t open to the general public.The diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Cuba didn’t always go down as smoothly as the cocktails served at the embassy’s bar. Though U.S.-Cuban relations prospered in the first half of the 20th century, the relationship deteriorated after the Cuban Revolution, eventually resulting in an embargo. Official diplomatic relations terminated in 1961 and the Cuban ambassador packed up and left Washington. Comrades from the Czechoslovakian Embassy thoughtfully served as house sitters over the next decade. During this tenure, the Post reported that, “shrubbery in front was damaged by Molotov cocktails allegedly hurled by Cuban veterans of the Bay of Pigs fighting.”In 1974 a string of airplane hijackers demanded to be flown to Havana, and the two countries recognized the need for some base level of cooperation. The Cuban diplomats again returned to their DC location, but this time with limited privileges. The building was technically an Interest Section, described by The Atlantic as a “sort-of-embassy,” and the diplomatic staff weren’t allowed to travel beyond the Capital Beltway or the Dulles corridor.The Cuban Interest Section building was bombed twice more by anti-Castro terrorists in 1978 and 1979. Luckily, no one was injured and the damage was limited to broken windows and a mangled air conditioner.Architectural firm Macneil & Macneil designed the stately three-story embassy building in 1916, two decades after Cuba gained its independence. Before that, the Cuban diplomats occupied a smaller brownstone mansion at 1750 Massachusetts Avenue.","When it opened during the final years of the embargo, all the drinks and cigars were free. ","Warder-Totten House,Serenity Statue,Washington Family Church National Cathedral","2630 16th Street NW Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.9242,-77.0369,Elliot CarterCollector of Experiences,2017-08-28 00:00:00,"Warder-Totten House,Washington Family Church National Cathedral,Serenity Statue,D.C.’s Floating Chandeliers","La Casa de los Azulejos,Vishrambaug Wada,Ungurmuiža Manor,Sigtuna Rådhus (City Hall)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cuban-embassys-hemingway-bar-washington-dc
622,Casa Grande Ruins,"national parks,intriguing environs,ecosystems,ruins,architectural oddities,architecture",818,1039,"Surrounded by a low, earthen wall and a number of agricultural canals, the Casa Grande Ruins in Arizona could have been a residence or a municipal hub, but whatever its original purpose, the four-story dirt pueblo has survived for centuries to give us a glimpse at America’s prehistoric history.In 1694, Padre Eusebio Francisco Kino, a Jesuit missionary, made his way across what is now the American Southwest. He may not have been the first European to encounter the Casa Grande ruins, but he was the first to make note of the ruins in a written account, unwittingly giving the ruins the name meaning “great house” that is still used today.Built by the ancient Sonoran people around 1350, the structure was abandoned only a century afterward, and was already in ruins by the time Kino came upon it. Little is known about the people who built Casa Grande except for their agricultural practices, as they left no writing behind, but interest in the ruins increased as expansion in the West continued.The Great House is only one of a complex of buildings within the site, and only one of a much larger culture that is spread throughout the valley from Tucson to Pheonix. A common feature in many of the sites in the area is a “ball court,” which the Casa Grande site has. It was used for a ball game that appears to have been standardized throughout the area and can be seen to the north of the monument’s parking lot.Another feature that is widespread is a series of canals that moved water from the Gila River to fields used for agriculture. In some cases, modern canals like the Central Arizona Project use the same canal pathways.Casa Grande has elements that allowed for observing the summer solstice, the equinoxes, and for measuring the lunar standstill, a phenomenon that occurs every 18.6 years. These can be seen in the upper corners of the building on the west side.When railroads were established nearby in the 1880s, the ruins became a popular destination for souvenir hunters and vandals who left early graffiti in the soft pueblo walls. In 1889, petitions to repair and preserve Casa Grande proved successful, and in 1892, President Benjamin Harrison set aside the structure and its surrounding land as the first prehistoric and cultural preserve in the United States.The first shelter for the ruins was built in 1901 and replaced with a second shelter in 1932, and now the incredible Casa Grande seems to sit like a building-sized abuela protecting itself with a sun umbrella. ",Some of the tallest ancient American ruins continue to inspire awe and curiosity. ,"The Domes,Casa Grande Neon Sign Park ,Tom Mix Monument ","1100 W Ruins Dr Coolidge, Arizona, 85128 United States",32.9953,-111.5362,barnumbrownielarahaggertyMatthew H WardRachelchasepoptRBARMatthew H WardchasepoptllarahaggertycyccommuteBlindcolourRBARccattypistRachel,2013-09-24 00:00:00,"Casa Grande Neon Sign Park ,The Domes,Tom Mix Monument ,Corona Satellite Calibration Targets","Uplistsikhe Cave Town,George Air Force Base,Casa de Fusta,Fordlândia",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-grande-ruins

The shop is the first of five Route 66 attractions to survive the creation of the interstate with its own, named exit.First opened in the 1940s, Jack Rabbit Trading Post is still in operation today, surviving the rise and fall of Route 66, as well as several different owners. Much of this prosperity owes to clever marketing: the original owner, James Taylor – no relation to the folk singer – put up billboards all along the Mother Road, from Arizona to Missouri, a tactic since copied by many a tourist trap. The hand-painted signs depicted the store’s iconic jackrabbit logo, culminating in a final HERE IT IS billboard beside the trading post. Few, if any, of the billboards remain, except for the (now legendary) HERE IT IS sign, which is repainted every few years. Jack Rabbit Trading Post was also parodied in Disney-Pixar’s Cars in 2006.

624,Pine Creek Gorge,"environmental disasters,nature",445,930,"Today Pennsylvania’s Pine Creek Gorge is often referred to as “The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania,” but in early 20th century the lush area was so clear-cut of its trees in the early 20th century that it was called “The Pennsylvania Desert.”Pine Creek Gorge is a 47-mile long, 1,000-feet deep valley stretching north to south from near Wellsboro to Waterville. Prime overlooks for the gorge are at Leonard Harrison State Park and Colton Point State Park on opposite banks. Covered by the Tioga State Forest for most of its length, Pine Creek Gorge is a popular spot along the Pennsylvania Route 6 corridor for fall foliage viewing.At the early part of the 20th century, however, the forests were razed for lumber. The hemlock, white pine, and hardwoods were very attractive for the lumber needs of the burgeoning country, and the forests here were harvested until the lands were barren. Fires consumed what little wood was left and baked the ground, turning the valley into a wasteland. In the hellish landscape landslides and flooding were common, and the wildlife was scattered.However as is often the case, time has healed things, and the forest eventually regrew. Today, the trees are second-growth and cover the gorge, allowing for long views of fall foliage. Harvests are carefully managed, trails allow hikers to walk the forest, and even black bears and bald eagles have returned to where the land above Pine Creek was once laid bare.","This lush forest valley was once mined for lumber to the extent that it was once nicknamed ""The Pennsylvania Desert."" ","Haunted Vista,Corning Glass Bulb Flag,Cherry Springs State Park","Pine Creek Gorge Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, 16901 United States",41.6963,-77.4547,thomasharperlittlebrumbledarabrown3237hannsharonrpatbryantx2lendog666,2014-10-15 00:00:00,"Corning Glass Bulb Flag,Haunted Vista,Cherry Springs State Park,Coudersport Ice Mine","Nine Mile Run,Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes,Tarra Falls,Birch Alley",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pine-creek-gorge

The objects in this alley are the legacy of this pioneering work. (Also on this mission were specially designed Coca-Cola and Pepsi cans intended to deliver soda to astronauts in the weightlessness of space. The cans apparently did not work as well as expected and were removed from the menu on future shuttle flights, but the cosmic ray detector worked better than expected and provided a treasure trove of data.)After the tragic Challenger explosion the following year and the subsequent grounding of the shuttle fleet, researchers switched to high-altitude balloons to bring their cosmic ray detectors to the edge of space. The two battered white objects are from these later balloon-borne missions.Apart from museums, this is quite possibly the closest you can get in the Chicago area to an object that has been in space.",One of the largest pieces of scientific equipment ever carried on a NASA space shuttle sits in a Chicago alley. ,"Concrete Traffic,Nuclear Energy,Dialogo","5601 S Drexel Ave Chicago, Illinois United States",41.7931,-87.6033,dpalmer01prototypepdSiFsugarbomb,2019-01-02 00:00:00,"Nuclear Energy,Concrete Traffic,Dialogo,Oriental Institute Museum","Skylab’s Remains,The Eye of Heaven,Goonhilly Earth Station,Bremen Drop Tower",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cosmic-ray-detectors

But Sant Pau in Barcelona, with a history that dates back six centuries, is a worthwhile detour from traditional medical architecture.In the late 19th century, Barcelona was expanding beyond its old city walls, and beyond the Hospital de la Santa Creuwhich had served the city since the early 1400s. In 1896 a wealthy Catalan banker named Pau Gil i Serra died, leaving behind a will that requested his estate be used for a new hospital that would utilize the newest available medical technology.A spot was chosen about two miles northeast from the old medieval hospital, which now houses the National Library of Catalonia. Catalan architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner designed the site, which would represent the merging of six of Barcelona’s hospitals.Domènech was an influential artist in Catalan Modernisme and Art Nouveau. He designed the 27-building complex that took up the equivalent of around nine city blocks to be interconnected by underground tunnels. Sixteen of the structures were built in the Modernist style and, though guidebooks and tourists often overlook the site, make up the largest Art Nouveau site in the world.The complex was finished in 1930, with each building representing a different medical specialty. The Hospital de Sant Pau was fully functioning until 2009, when a new building, erected in the northern half of the complex, took over the duties. Several of the historic buildings were refurbished over the next several years.The site, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, reopened to the public in 2014 and now serves as spaces for events, meetings, and tours of the Art Nouveau style.

There were Kilroys in Japan, the Philippines, France, and Italy. One mysteriously even made its way into Joseph Stalin’s private bathroom at the Potsdam Conference, prompting questions from the paranoid dictator.The whole thing started with an American rivet inspector named James Kilroy who would scrawl his name all over the interiors of Liberty Ships after certifying parts as complete. Pat Tillery of KilroyWasHere.org described in an interview how, “sailors would [subsequently] go down into the bilges and find ‘Kilroy Was Here’ all over, in places where nobody had ever been before on brand new ships.” The unexpected ubiquity of the phrase was amusing, and people started retagging it everywhere as a sort of joke.After arriving overseas, the troops encountered a widespread English cartoon of a bald fellow that had similar humorous connotations and the two memes were quickly joined together.The Kilroy graffiti, “was comfort and a little bit rebellion, because they were told not to, but it spread all over the world,” says Tillery. “No matter how bad it got crawling out of that foxhole everyday, when they found a Kilroy they’d know someone was there before and survived. It was so important to every GI.” The original cartoons were fleeting wonders, commonly drawn with fading chalk, pencil, or whatever else was at hand. It’s fitting that at the Washington World War II Memorial, two symmetrical Kilroys have been etched into the stone, one near the backside of the PA pillar, and the other opposite it. These etchings keep the little story alive, and let veterans know that Kilroy is still with GIs whenever they are in harm’s way.",There’s a hidden military meme engraved on the World War II Memorial. ,"Fireworks Safety Zone on the National Mall,The Lockkeeper's House,Potomac Park Flood Levee","1964 Independence Ave SW Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.8895,-77.041,Elliot Cartere1savagebribolioGlobal Debaucherybatmanminer20notoriousFIGjjlord7Global DebaucherybribolioJJumbotobbatmanminer20Collector of Experiencese1savagenotoriousFIG,2017-08-28 00:00:00,"Potomac Park Flood Levee,Fireworks Safety Zone on the National Mall,The Lockkeeper's House,D.C.

633,The London Stone,"rites and rituals,monuments",621,1041,"London Stone is a historic artifact housed behind a glass panel in Cannon Street (previously visible behind an iron grill until 2018), stirring up all kinds of mystique and intrigue – and rightly so.The stone is a block of limestone and is of a sort that is not naturally found in or around the London area. Geologists have concluded that the nearest source for its origin would be in Kent, which is 60 miles away.The original reason it was brought to London is unknown. The earliest written reference to the London Stone is in a book belonging to King Athelstan in the early 10th century. It was used as a common transportation landmark in the 12th century when it was referred to as the Londenstane.Texts from the 17th and 18th centuries suggest that it was actually a central marker from which all distances to related cities or townships were measured back in Roman times.The London Stone is sometimes called the Stone of Brutus, referring to the mythical Trojan founder of London. Popular tales include the stone being the remains of an ancient stone circle that is alleged to have stood on nearby Ludgate Hill. In other legends, it was associated with the mythical King Arthur, as so many ancient objects tend to be in England.Although there are no references that suggest that the stone had any symbolic authority, in 1450 Jake Cade, leader of a rebellion against Henry VI, struck his sword against it and declared himself “Lord of the City.” The event was dramatized in Shakespeare’s play Henry VI.In the 15th century, the stone was commonplace for meetings, the taking of oaths, and the making of official proclamations. The Lord Mayor of London would strike the stone with staff on Mayor’s Day as a proclamation of authority. ","This legendary stone is of unknown origin, and throughout history has been a literal touchstone for British leaders. ","Mansion House Square,Temple of Mithras,Signs of Old Lombard Street","Cannon Street London, England, EC4N 5AR United Kingdom",51.5116,-0.0895,VordeniusGavinMartinMark CaseyRachelstevephillips23llsz11495Snowdrop68ccharlie 836d8a33AdOYoGavinzydekoDDenverApplehansSEANETTAmikegtnsstevephillips23ttimmcnultyMMartinRachelMark Casey,2013-02-19 00:00:00,"Mansion House Square,Signs of Old Lombard Street,Temple of Mithras,Monument to the Great Fire of London","The Blessing of the Fleets Ceremony,The Ceremonial South Pole,Beijing Ancient Architecture Museum / Xiannongtan (Temple of Agriculture),Mount Osore",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/london-stone

Twelve of its 13 gargoyles were so badly ruined from water damage they had to be removed. The work was carried out by an Edinburgh-based stone masonry company, which replaced the carvings with newer models.Apparently, some of the stone masons had a bit of fun with their creations. One of the gargoyles is certainly unique, which is fitting, as medieval tradition holds that no two gargoyles can look the same. The creature bears a strong resemblance to H.R.

636,Chamberí Ghost Station,"subways,trains,transportation,museums",227,933,"Travelers on the Madrid Metro’s line 1 (the “blue” line) have probably noticed an old station flashing through the train car’s windows for a few seconds between the Bilbao and Iglesia stops. This is the now-disused Estación de Chamberí, and its history provides an instructive glimpse at the history of the Madrid Metro itself.One of eight stations on the Metro’s first line, the Chamberí station linked the nascent system to the Plaza de Chamberí above. Opened in 1919, this inaugural version of the Metro ran for four kilometers, from Cuarto Caminos to Puerta del Sol. However, this modest start would quickly become a popular and vital part of the urban landscape, expanding rapidly over the following decades to become one of the longest and most comprehensive metro systems in the world.During the turbulent years of the Spanish Civil War, the station provided shelter from the deadly bombing campaigns and artillery assaults of the Nationalist forces (and their Nazi allies) to terrified and shell-shocked Madrileños who would sleep within the station. Several diesel engines in the station were also used by the Republican government to power huge parts of the city during the war. As part of its progressive expansion, the trains on line 1 were lengthened in the 1960s. This meant the end for Chamberí. Because it was built on a curve and close to both Bilbao and Iglesia, lengthening the station’s platform proved both pointless and basically impossible. Chamberí was closed on May 22, 1966. The rails, however, were not moved, nor the trains rerouted, so it served for decades thereafter as the mystery station glimpsed by passengers on trains merely passing through. The rails and overhead electric lines continued to be maintained, but the rest of the station fell into dilapidation and disrepair. It remained, however, a sealed example of the transit systems origins, and thus rehabilitation efforts began in 2006 to transform Estación de Chamberí into a museum chronicling the history of the Madrid Metro. Opened in 2008, the museum, called Andén 0, or “Platform Zero,” features a fully restored Chamberí, complete with old ticket offices, turnstiles, maps, and a film about the building of the Metro.The main attraction, however, is found in the beautifully reconstructed original ads lining the walls of the platform, composed of tiny, brilliantly-colored tiles just as they were in 1919. Just don’t be startled by the trains that still rumble through this abandoned-station-turned-museum, separated from the exhibit area only by a clear glass barrier.Update as of January 2020: The Chamberí Ghost Station is open and free of charge. ","Abandoned for decades, trains still pass through the now-restored remains of one of Madrid's first metro stations. ","Frontón Beti-Jai,Spain's Good Luck Frog,Relics of St. Valentine at Iglesia de San Antón","38-40 Calle de Luchana Madrid, 28010 Spain",40.4323,-3.6977,fernandezlagomundotorpeMonsieur MictlanhrnickXavixavirLuis MoratopphilcalvertXavixavirMonsieur MictlanLuis MoratomundotorpeAAlcazarRHyzerhrnick,2016-05-26 00:00:00,"Frontón Beti-Jai,Relics of St. Valentine at Iglesia de San Antón,Spain's Good Luck Frog,Museo Lazaro Galdiano ","London Transport Museum Depot,Travel Town Museum,Nevada Northern Railway Museum,Fish Car No. 3",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chamberi-ghost-station

Once mighty steamships, many built for war, these vessels now serve as a decaying refuge for woodland creatures.Close to 230 shipwrecks litter the bay in what is believed to be the largest shipwreck fleet in the Western Hemisphere. (Chuuk Lagoon being the largest in the world.). Dozens can still be seen in the shallow waters, remnants of the latest (and priciest) shipbuilding project in history.When the U.S. entered WWI, the military was coming up a little short on transport vessels, so 1,000 wooden steamships were approved for construction under the tight deadline of just 18 months. With a rapidly approaching due date and a supply of steel  that was reserved for ships that would see battle, the rush job was just that. It resulted in poorly constructed wooden ships that, despite the time saving methods used, didn’t come anywhere close to being ready in time. By the time the Germans had surrendered, not a single ship from the lofty order had crossed the ocean.With the war over and steel once again in abundance, the ships, mostly unused, became obsolete and were discarded, left to rot in the Potomac. Two salvages were attempted but were, for the most part, unsuccessful due to cost and sheer magnitude.In the 1960s, an effort to clean up the bay was begun in earnest, and research was conducted to inventory, judge cost, and measure the environmental effects of the ships. During that research, it was discovered that the shipwrecks had, in their non-toxic wooden state, become the foundation of an active and thriving ecosystem. Acting as vessels for new life, the ghost ships will remain in the bay until they crumble away to nothing in the waters where they rest.","The remnants of a wooden-hulled fleet built and abandoned in WWI, now home to a thriving ecosystem. ","Staff Sgt.

638,Berkeley Mystery Walls,"walls,mystery,archaeology",90,930,"There are remnants of ancient stone walls all over the East Bay, and no one knows how old they are, who built them, or why. Though people have been pondering the enigma of the  Berkeley Mystery Walls for well over a hundred years, no conclusions have been reached, and despite wild speculation, no serious scholarly study has ever been undertaken.Stretching for over 50 miles, the East Bay “Mystery Walls” are found up and down the hills of the East Bay from Berkeley to San Jose. The stone walls are up to five feet tall in places, and are constructed from boulders of varying sizes, some weighing up to a ton. The walls run in broken sections, anywhere from a few meters to half a mile in length, and are placed in unlikely and inaccessible places. They seem to serve no known purpose. They are not continuous or high enough to act as an enclosure, or measure of defense. They are clearly, visibly, very old. The heavy stones have sunk deep into the ground, and they are overgrown with lichen. After meandering throughout the Oakland hills, they head inland towards Mt. Diablo where they lead to mysterious stone circles, up to 30 feet in diameter. In one place the walls form a spiral 200 feet wide that circles a large boulder.The Spanish settlers in the area reported that the walls were already there when they arrived, and when they asked the local Ohlone American Indians, they said the same thing. In 1904, the founder of the Contra Costa Club said the walls were clearly of prehistoric origin and could be evidence that an advanced civilization had once settled in the East Bay. Also in 1904, the professor of Oriental languages at UC Berkeley declared that the walls were surely the work of settlers from Mongolia, as the Chinese tended to wall in their cities, and the mystery walls were reminiscent of the Great Wall of China. Others have theorized that they were built by the early Missionaries, and still others wonder if Sir Frances Drake did not leave colonists behind at the site where he completed the circumnavigation of the globe. While speculations abound, the “Mystery Walls of the East Bay,” or the “Great Wall of California” remains a mystery to this day.Visitors can investigate the Mystery Walls for themselves at several East Bay parks including Tilden Regional Park in Orinda, Ed. R Levin County park in Santa Clara, and Mission Peak Regional Preserve in Alameda County. ",Neither Spanish settlers nor anyone since has been able to tell who built these strange California rock walls. ,"Bosco the Dog Mayor,California School for the Blind,Sunol Water Temple","Fremont, California, 94539 United States 37.5117, -121.8777Book a hotel on Kayak NearbySunol Water Temple5.11 milesBosco the Dog Mayor5.72 milesCalifornia School for the Blind5.95 miles",37.5117,-121.8777,thirdthresholdclairebewarenadpete,2013-06-02 00:00:00,"Sunol Water Temple,Bosco the Dog Mayor,California School for the Blind,Drawbridge","Duino Mithraeum,Valerian Wall at Niche Hotel,Proteichisma on Erysichthonos Street,Klafthmonos Square Parking Structure Fortification Walls",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berkeley-mystery-walls
639,Paris Padlocks of Love,"love locks,rites and rituals,bridges",3668,927,"Paris is the city of love, so it’s fitting that the French capital has several thriving love lock locations. Love locks — a modern ‘tradition’ whereby sweethearts inscribe their names or initials on a padlock, attach it to a public structure, and throw away the key, permanently sealing their love — used to adorn the Pont des Arts, the footbridge that crosses the Seine from the Left Bank to the Louvre, as well as the Pont de l’Archevêché, in the shadow of Notre Dame Cathedral.Several years ago, following political discussions about whether the locks were an eyesore or detrimental to the integrity of the city’s architecture, the Pont des Arts was mysteriously cleared one night and locks are now routinely removed from various locations around the city.Many locals consider the lovelocks to be a serious problem that threaten bridges and other important landmarks due to the accumulated weight of the locks. However, in June of 2014, part of the Pont des Arts bridge had to be closed when one of its metal grills collapsed, lugged down by the locks. In May of 2015, the city council decided to remove all of them (45 tonnes in total) and install panels to prevent people from fixing new ones.Of course, tourists bemoan the removal of the love locks, complaining that this is a loved Parisian tradition. However, it is perhaps worth remembering that The Pont des Arts was built under the reign of Napoleon I, and love locks only started appearing in 2008!Of course, love locks haven’t disappeared from the bridges over the Seine. Indeed, padlock and permanent marker pen vendors do a thriving trade on and alongside the bridges. However, lovers beware, city authorities often remove locks from landmarks, breaking them, and perhaps breaking the love the locks were supposed to secure?Update 2016: The locks were cut off the bridge for safety purposes.Update 2022: While the locks have returned to the Pont des Arts as well as other Parisian bridges and their surroundings, it is unclear whether they’ll remain there for a while or not.",The celebrated eyesore created by starry-eyed sweethearts. ,"Execution Site of Jacques de Molay,Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint),Mascarons of Pont Neuf","Pont des Arts Paris, 75006 France",48.8578,2.3374,amyfreebornEvarinOliviaRoseFred CherrygardenSimon JonesMolly McBride JacobsonSarah Vanheel CosmopoliClanFred CherrygardenggpaulusRindy99Luis MoratoOOliviaRoseSimon JonesMolly McBride JacobsonEEvarinLucyKGKatieBushadda dadaRachel,2012-02-14 00:00:00,"Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint),Mascarons of Pont Neuf,Execution Site of Jacques de Molay,Maison de Serge Gainsbourg","Brooklyn Bridge Love Locks,Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge),Ponte dei Pugni (Bridge of Fists),Love Locks of Västerbron",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paris-padlocks-of-love
640,Avatar Hallelujah Mountain,"government,national parks,film locations,film,mountains,bridges",135,927,"It wasn’t until 1982 that China created its first national park: Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. They couldn’t have chosen a better site—Zhangjiajie is famous for its 3,000 vertical pillars, each hundreds of feet tall and covered in dense green foliage. These pillars were formed by erosion and draw in upwards of 30 million tourists every year.One of these pillars was named the “Southern Sky Column, ”and it stretched 3,544 feet into the air, the length of 78 school buses. In a strange turn of art imitating life imitating art, in 2010 the name was changed to “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” after the highest-grossing film of all time, Avatar, used photographs of the pinnacle as inspiration for the floating Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora. This was part of a successful attempt to bring more tourists into the national park, using phrases like “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near” and “discover the real world of Pandora.”This, of course, was not all good news for the Chinese government. The state-run “China Film Group” was afraid that Avatar would inspire people to make connections between the plight of Pandora’s fictional “Na’vi” people, who were being displaced from their land for the purpose of economic expansion, and the plight of the millions of real Chinese civilians being evicted from their homes to serve the interests of urban developers. Hence, in a wildly controversial move, just 14 days after being released in China, Avatar was prematurely taken off of 1,628 2D screens.Two weeks too late. By that point Avatar had already become China’s highest-grossing film of all time, and “Avatar Hallelujah Mountain” continues to be the name of the pinnacle, despite the government’s censorship efforts of the film.The connection to Avatar has surged the popularity of Zhangjiajie. To cater to the more adventurous tourists in the area, a new attraction was built in the national park in 2015: the longest glass bridge in the world.",This vertical pinnacle in China was the inspiration for the floating mountains in the movie “Avatar.” ,"Tianmen Shan,Bailong Elevator,Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge","Zhangjiajie China 29.3149, 110.4331Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyBailong Elevator0.10 milesTianmen Shan13.99 milesZhangjiajie Glass Bridge17.00 miles",29.3149,110.4331,lewblankJacoblab1Martessa,2016-05-23 00:00:00,"Bailong Elevator,Tianmen Shan,Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge,Tianmen Skywalk","Western Town at Paramount Ranch ,Bridge Street Bridge,Death Railway Bridge,Haohan Qiao — ""Brave Men's Bridge""",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/avatar-hallelujah-mountain

But private gardens were his true passion, and he established the non-profit Garden Conservancy to help protect and care for gardens that might otherwise lose in a fight against land developers. Les Jardins de Quatre-Vents, or the Garden of the Four Winds, took shape toward the end of Cabot’s life. He settled into his family estate in Quebec by creating his second major personal garden, this one on the St. Lawrence about 90 miles north of Quebec City. Spread out over 20 lush acres of rolling lawns and intricate boxwood hedges, calling it “a garden” doesn’t begin to describe it. It’s actually about 25 different gardens — including Japanese, rose, white, rock, sculpture, shade, and kitchen gardens. There are exotic and rare Asian plants, reflecting pools and waterfalls, and the St. Lawrence River itself—Les Jardins de Quatre-Vents’ major water feature.The gardens are open to the public for four days every summer with tours led by the Ecology Center in Port-au-Saumon. And the fees collected go to help support their environmental outreach and education.

There are also plenty of opportunities for wading in the creek (although swimming is not allowed), and there are picnic shelters as well. Of course, if you want to just spread your blanket in the shade beneath some of the beautiful trees, nobody will stop you. This unique nature preserve is all about getting people outside and back into nature.Several of the older trees in the park were destroyed in a storm that came through the area in 1993, and instead of allowing the trees to be cut down and taken away, Mr. Tingle began carving them to add to the beauty of Orr Park. Today, squirrels, men, alligators, and even a dragon are carved on dead trees all around the park, adding to the mystic nature of the already beautiful scenery. Only dead trees expand his menagerie; living trees are left alone. There are over 30 carvings around the park, and more are always being created.A book detailing all of the “Tinglewood Carvings” is available through Montevallo City Hall.The Tinglewood Festival, started in September 2018, is held every year at Orr Park, usually on the first Saturday in September. ",Orr Park's dead trees have been carved into a menagerie of whimsical visages.  ,"Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park,Pettus Randall Miniature Museum of American History,Red Mountain Park","277 Park Dr Montevallo, Alabama, 35115 United States",33.0978,-86.8565,ladypalutenaRachel PreskittFitz For ShortCollector of ExperiencestinewattsrebecaschandelFitz For Shorttinewattsrrosalita57wendiravenRachel PreskittrebecaschandelCollector of Experiencesplanan,2016-03-22 00:00:00,"Pettus Randall Miniature Museum of American History,Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park,Red Mountain Park,African Village in America","Balloch Park Fairy Trail,Dolliver Park,Crooked Slide Park,Brea Redwood Grove",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tinglewood-carvings

This quest for the perfect jail led to some odd and often inhumane forms of incarceration, some of which still survive. One such example is the rotary jail, the only still working example of which is Indiana’s Rotary Jail Museum. Rotary jails were a unique innovation in penitentiary design where the cells were wedge-shaped spaces arranged around a central hub. The entire hub could then be spun by a mechanism beneath the cells that was controlled by a hand crank. The cells would spin around so that the door could only be accessed from one opening. This innovation almost caught on in the late 1800s and somewhere between six and eighteen of the spinning jails were built in America. Unfortunately the almost whimsical prisons had the fatal habit of trapping inmates’ limbs in between the bars, breaking and crushing them. After a number of such incidents, most of the rotary jails were closed or converted to a more stationary operation. Today the only still operating example of the rotary jails is one in Crawfordsville, Indiana. While the jail no longer holds criminals, the massive gear beneath the cells can still rotate, standing as a strange example of innovation outstripping utility.",The first spinning jail built in the United States is the only one that still turns. ,"Myers Dinner Theater,Jungle Park Speedway,General Lew Wallace Study & Museum","225 N Washington St Crawfordsville, Indiana, 47933 United States",40.0428,-86.9015,MrsZoomerjefferyinfinitylimitedcorpmcvette82,2014-12-05 00:00:00,"General Lew Wallace Study & Museum,Myers Dinner Theater,Jungle Park Speedway,Cholera Mass Graves of Fink Cemetery ","The Chapel of Our Lady ,The Sugar House Prison Window,Pottawattamie Squirrel Cage Jail,Lukiškės Prison",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rotary-jail-museum

645,Cementland,"abandoned amusement parks,inventions,outsider architecture,outsider art,collections,abandoned,architectural oddities,architecture",164,1041,"It was once the trash heap of local industry. An abandoned and run down former cement factory, the decrepit lot on Riverview Drive had become a common site for local construction crews to dump truckloads of excess dirt and rock. The old factory meant so little, no one cared or tried to reroute them.But when sculptor and visionary Bob Cassilly looked at the site, he saw something more. He saw an art amusement park celebrating the history of cement production in St. Louis, filled with statues and sculptures and old machinery turned into fascinating attractions, and that’s what he began to build in the space.Locations with formerly booming industries often find themselves with the opportunity to celebrate their cultural and economic history with an amusement park exhibiting that glory. Southern Indiana, known for its famous limestone quarries, has its half-constructed limestone pyramid. In Vietnam, there is the Suoi Tien Cultural Theme Park, celebrating the local Buddhist tradition.Bob Cassilly had already put St. Louis’s name on the oddball art park map with the City Museum, a sprawling playhouse built from repurposed industrial and architectural objects. Cementland was his opportunity to create again, this time with acres to expand. So he got a bulldozer and combined it with his artistic ambition. The park would fit right in with his long history of whimsical, playful sculptures and projects, all hinging on the intersection between childhood nostalgia and subversive counterculture. He invited the construction crews to keep dumping their leftover dirt — it was simply more material for him to play with. To create with.Before long he had created a castle of sorts out of the old factory, with a courtyard of sculpted creations made of cement, rock, metal and antique machinery. Bridges spanned spillways and depressions where water would collect into pools to form moats and ponds. In short order, people caught notice, and couldn’t wait to see what the project, still in its infancy, would eventually become.Unfortunately, in 2011, Cassilly tragically died when the bulldozer he was operating allegedly tipped off of an unstable ledge and rolled over, although his widow and several medical experts believe he was intentionally beaten to death, the bulldozer accident simply being a cover-up. Regardless, he died doing what he loved, but what he loved was far from finished.Today, the unfinished park, still closed to the public, is an attractive spot for oddity searchers, sculpture fans, graffiti artists, and late-night teenagers. There are no illusions that it is complete or well-maintained at this point, but Bob’s widow, Giovanna Cassilly, hopes to keep the project going. She launched a website to collect inquiries and information for curious and supportive fans. After years of probate proceedings, the 55-acre Cementland was released to her in the fall of 2015 and building may resume.Memorials to Bob Cassilly have been held in the park, candlelight vigils and the launching of lit balloons into the night sky. But perhaps the best memorial to the man, his life, and his ideas, is all around you when you visit - the park itself.Update December 9 2016: A heavy warehouse fire raged at the cement factory, causing the roof to fall in. Over 60 firefighters worked through the night to put out the blaze.Update May 2017: A private security outfit has been hired to prevent trespassing. Update Feb 2022:  No evidence of any security.

Together, they form a nature reserve called Las Salinas de Torrevieja. One lake in particular stands out, as its eye-catching bubblegum pink color overshadows its green-tinted neighbor.When looking at Torrevieja from above, it looks as though a colossal strawberry milkshake melted and the gooey mess pooled just outside the city. But the odd sight isn’t caused by a slew of unnatural ingredients. It’s actually the work of bacteria and algae.Halobacterium (also known as “salt bacterium”) thrive in salty places, as does a micro-algae called Dunaliella salina. These are the two magic ingredients that concoct the lake’s bizarre hue. Despite its funky color, the water is perfectly fine, though it can get a bit smelly.Torrevieja relies on its salt lakes. People have been collecting the mineral from the waters for centuries. In the early 19th century, they officially became a hub for Spain’s salt industry. In addition to boosting the city’s economy, the lakes also act like a natural spa. Supposedly, the sludge of mud and salt at the bottom have healing properties than can relieve common skin and respiratory ailments. The water’s high salt concentration makes it a fun place to relax and enjoy floating around with ease.Flamingos, much like the local people, also frequent the pink lake.

647,Pooh's House,"literature,trees,plants",239,925,"Pooh’s house is a tiny, painted door at the base of a tree stump that has been a fixture of the Harvard University campus for decades, though it has a complicated history that’s not always sunny. It’s a little piece of Harvard that’s worth the visit—if you can bend down far enough to see it properly. Pooh’s house wasn’t always the only local residence for citizens of the hundred-acre wood. A decade ago, Rabbit and Piglet both lived within a half-mile, in squirrel-sized homes nestled in the bases of other trees. Adults would generally only notice the houses if they happened to drop something, or pause to tie their shoes, at precisely the right place. It was most often children who spotted the painted doors—who creaked them open to reveal the damp, spidery foyers within.Neither Rabbit nor Piglet themselves ever made an appearance; their foyers always seemed to be empty. Perhaps they were visiting Pooh, drinking tea generously blobbed with honey. Or simply sitting in a back room, just beyond the spongy space where the wood curved into darkness.But those trees were long ago felled to make room for crayon-colored chairs and sunbathing freshmen. Only Pooh’s house remains—though his tree, too, was cut during the 2012 renovation that tore up the cement outside the Harvard Science Center. For a while his stump sat bare, cordoned off by construction fencing. Pooh’s door disappeared, and along with it his home. It became, for a time, just a vacant hollow, a space between knobby roots.But after a few months a wooden roof appeared to cap the exposed stump. Soon a new door was installed, and a freshly painted sign that read “Pooh.” One can only assume that Pooh himself moved back in, pots of honey in hand.For a few years his house thrived. A tiny piece of Christopher Robin’s woods, right outside the Science Center. Every day students passed, backpacks heavy with physics notebooks. Tourists paused for pictures. Pooh was there —he must have been—just out of sight behind his painted door. Eating a snack, perhaps, or taking a nap. But paint will chip and wood, too, will soften. Pooh’s house seemed to fall apart all at once. The sign fell, first. A rainstorm, perhaps—or maybe the work of an industrious squirrel. Soon after the door disappeared, pried off its tiny hinges by vandals. The living room behind it became, again, just an empty hollow, a spongy dip in wood. The skeleton of Pooh’s house sits, still, outside the Science Center. The roof is mostly intact. Every day students lock their bikes beside it, jogging to make it to chemistry class. But Pooh himself is nowhere to be found. He might be gone for good. Maybe he’s moved in with Owl, or into Eeyore’s shack. Or perhaps he’s just waiting, hidden in some unobtrusive, spidery hollow. On the lookout for a new door, and a fresh coat of paint.","This tiny, painted door at the base of a tree stump has been a fixture of the Harvard University campus for decades. ","Blaschka Glass Flowers,Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments Mark I,Old Burial Ground","1 Oxford St Cambridge, Massachusetts United States",42.3763,-71.1166,cwhitenocklebysophie hatteralbastarrGiaVoychris 22c068e8tjdimacalissophie hatterGGiaVoyccait7911cchris 22c068e8tjdimacalialbastarr,2017-01-09 00:00:00,"Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments Mark I,Old Burial Ground,Blaschka Glass Flowers,John Harvard 'Statue of Three Lies'","Torquato Tasso's Oak Tree,Chatham Catalpas,The Autograph Tree,Oxford Botanic Garden",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poohs-house

Completed in 1901, the Elephant Gate was part of a building complex for the Ny (New) Carlsberg Brewhouse, started by Carl Jacobson to compete directly with his father who owned the original Carlsberg Brewery (thereafter renamed the Gamle — or Old — Carlsberg Brewery).When first launching this contentious new venture in 1882, Carl felt the need to adopt a symbol that would bring good luck and prosperity and chose the swastika, which since ancient times had been associated with good fortune (in fact, the word “swastika” comes from a Sanskrit word meaning “lucky or auspicious object”). Used in the official trademark for Ny Carlsberg, the swastika suddenly became quite inauspicious in the 1930s, and its use by the brewery was forever discontinued in 1940.The elephant statues, however, remain and include other symbolism beyond the now-stomach-churning good luck charms. Each elephant bears the initials of one of Carl’s four remaining children (four other children had died by the time the gate was built); thus, the swastikas were meant not only to bring good fortune to the brewery but also health and prosperity to each surviving child. Moreover, Carl saw elephants themselves as symbols of stability, vigor, and loyalty — an image which is perhaps somewhat undercut by going into business against your dad, but was generally pretty good for the brand long-term. Carl sponsored the elephants at the Copenhagen Zoo; the brewery stables occasionally housed elephants; and Carlsberg eventually launched a strong, rich, “Elephant Beer” in 1959.The Elephant Gate is the most famous Carlsberg landmark, and once served as one of two portals to the Ny Carlsberg complex. The tower above the gate once served as a water tower and herb silo, but now it stands vacant, as does the rest of the old facility; on-site beer production stopped entirely in 2008, and the landmarked buildings are now being redeveloped into a new residential neighborhood.Update: As of August 2019, the gate is currently obstructed by construction. ",Pre-Nazi swastikas adorn the sculpted pachyderms flanking this brewhouse portal. ,"Leif Sonne's Bottled Beer Collection,Wehrmacht Graffiti,Cisternerne","Near Ny Carlsberg Vej 140 Copenhagen, 1760 Denmark",55.6673,12.5323,duncbfcJohan SWERHyzerTaterchipsBlindcolourJohan SWETTaterchipsbreaingramCollector of ExperiencesLuis MoratodduncbfcBlindcolourRHyzer,2016-03-30 00:00:00,"Leif Sonne's Bottled Beer Collection,Cisternerne,Wehrmacht Graffiti,Tivoli Gardens","Brauerei Hofstetten, Bow & Arrow Brewing Co.,Taedonggang Brewing Company,The Lemp Family Tomb",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elephant-gate

But inside, the doors open up to a treasure trove of movie magic, including monsters, snakes in jars, rows and rows of grisly medieval arms, and shelves full of the clutter one might stumble over in any castle, witch cave, or torture dungeon. Costumes ranging in genre, time period, and realism hang neatly on racks, but perhaps the most intriguing and eye-catching collection to marvel over is what is considered Global’s shining star – their space suits.The suits are so realistic that NASA is one of Global’s biggest customers. Suits that have actually made the amazing journey out of the atmosphere and into the beyond rarely come home in decent shape, if they come home at all. When Buzz Aldrin is dressed in his astronaut best for photo shoots and dedication ceremonies, he is wearing a replica space suit – the real deal costs more than any production could possibly afford, and can weigh up to 3 times what a Global replica does.Serving as the go-to for countless film, TV and commercial productions for spacesuit rentals, Global Effects also supplies museums and displays all over the world. NASA rents the suits and hires Global technicians to handle them whenever a former moonwalker dons one for a magazine shoot or an appearance. A complicated operation despite their being facsimiles, the suits are multi-layered with authentic locking rings, lights and ventilation systems. Some even require the wearer to climb scaffolding and slip into the suits through a hatch in the back. The suits are considered lightweight at 75-80 lb., and at somewhere around $2000 a week they are attainable and convenient for film productions and NASA productions alike.NASA was so impressed with Global’s replicas that they challenged the owner Chris Gilman and partner Denis Gilliam to design a real suit for them. The result of this was a manufactured prototype EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) spacesuit.With the privatization of the space industry, it doesn’t seem like such a leap to think that the master replicators of the most authentic fakes in Hollywood could someday be designing the real thing.",Where the line between entertainment and aerospace blurs. ,"Nethercutt Collection and Museum,APEX Electronics,Bob Hope Grave and Memorial Garden","12424 Gladstone Ave Los Angeles, California, 91342 United States",34.2961,-118.4115,RachelrynosbackCraig BakerMartin,2013-04-15 00:00:00,"Nethercutt Collection and Museum,Bob Hope Grave and Memorial Garden,APEX Electronics,Wat Thai Temple Food Market","Hidden Figures Way,Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex,Plum Brook Station (Neil A.

652,Skunk Ape Research Headquarters,"cryptozoology,hoaxes and pseudoscience,animals",348,926,"Dave Shealy is the Jane Goodall of the Florida Everglades. Shealy has spent his entire life studying a smelly hominid cryptid known as the Skunk Ape, and has established the official Skunk Ape Research Headquarters in Ochopee, Florida. Here, Shealy conducts studies, investigates reports on sightings, and brings awareness to the elusive creature of the Everglades.Shealy is aware that the Skunk Ape – like its alleged distant relative, Big Foot – is considered by many to be a figment of imagination. The United States National Park Service even refers to the creature as nothing more than a “local myth.” Despite the lack of serious attention paid to his cause, Shealy insists that there are 7-9 Skunk Apes currently living in the Everglades, and he has been working tirelessly to document their existence.The Skunk Ape earns its name for its unusual odor, which some have likened to the smell of rotting garbage, methane or, quite simply, skunks. Some researchers attribute the mammal’s odor to its natural habitat of alligator dens “filled with swamp gas and animal cadavers,” while others maintain that the smell is a result of their lack of bathing. Regardless, all Skunk Ape sightings have made reference to their distinct scent.According to Shealy, an average male Skunk Ape reportedly stands 6-7 feet tall and weighs roughly 450 lbs. Females are considerably smaller, standing only 5-6 feet tall and weighing only up to 250 lbs. Both sexes are covered in long, reddish or black hair – similar to that of an Orangutan or Gorilla – and stand upright on two legs. Castings made of their footprints have established four toes on each foot. Seasonal stool samples have indicated that their omnivorous diet consists of bird nestlings, wild hogs and native berries.Though there have been thousands of Big Foot-like sightings over the past few decades, almost all have been reported as spontaneous events. That is to say, most people who go out in search of hominid cryptids often do not find success. Such is not the case for Shealy, who has encountered three Skunk Ape sightings in the course of his field studies.Since his first sighting at the age of 10, Shealy has been documenting his methods on how to “bait” Skunk Apes. He has compiled these tips into his Everglades Skunk Ape Research Field Guide, which is sold both online and at the Ochopee headquarters. Such tips include instructions on properly “wetting” lima beans (a Skunk Ape’s favorite treat), and a reminder to store deer liver on ice.Though Shealy has created Skunk Ape baiting tactics, he is vehemently opposed to the poaching or capturing of these mystical creatures. In fact, Shealy recommends that anyone who encounters a Skunk Ape should wait five days before publicizing their findings, so as to give the Skunk Ape sufficient time to leave the area. Additionally, Shealy has been featured on The Daily Show and various TLC and Travel Channel programs, where he has educated people on the Skunk Ape and the fragile ecosystem of the Everglades.Visitors to the Skunk Ape Research Headquarters can purchase Skunk Ape memorabilia and educational materials (complete with Shealy’s own personal illustrations), as well as experience a reptile and exotic bird exhibition.

This however is not the case for this diner as it has a bottom level.With their distinctive curved edges, Paramounts were the first single-story diners to offer an all stainless steel exterior, the now iconic look of a vintage American diner. The diner’s name was changed again, to Dishes, which is still bears today.  The Hartford Preservation Alliance is constantly fighting to save the beautiful example of the diners that once were found throughout the United States, but have been torn down, one by one.

With whirling rides, organ music, and brightly glowing lights, it attracted thousands to the shores of the little island to revel in wholesome fun.For almost 100 years it was only accessible by classic steam-powered riverboats: The SS Ste. Clair and SS Columbia brought passengers from Detroit, each boat could bring up to 2,500 visitors at a time. Smaller ferries brought visitors from nearby Amhertsberg, Ontario and Gibraltar, Michigan.The dance hall, financed by Henry Ford, was once the second largest in the world and capable of holding 5,000 dancers. It also featured one of the world’s largest orchestrions, an automated self-playing orchestra machine, which features 419 pipes and its very own percussion section. There were also big band nights, which drew “black and tans,” multiracial crowds of young people during the 1920s.Attractions included rides such as the Nightmare, the Wild Mouse, and the Screamer as well as a Ferris wheel, a zoo, and the popular “Scootaboats.” Needless to say, the amusement park brought joy to all those who visited. Detroiters even referred to Boblo Island as “the Coney Island of Michigan.”But the old-fashioned charm of Boblo Island was eclipsed by more modern attractions like Cedar Point in its later decades, leading it to close its gates for good in 1993.

655,The Edward Gorey House,"cats,collections,museums and collections,animals",349,926,"When the prolific illustrator and author Edward Gorey died in 2000, the floors of his home sagged under the weight of 25,000 books, several cats, and assorted collections of eclectic items gathered over the course of years at Saturday flea market outings, as well as 75 unpublished manuscripts. Lucky for the world, rather than parceling these all out, the illustrator’s home and collection were converted into a museum dedicated to his life and works.Gorey was born in Chicago in 1925 to an artistic family, and by the time he enrolled at Harvard to study French in the 1950s, he was already an established dandy. According to the Harvard Magazine, “He arrived sporting a full-length sheepskin-lined coat, sneakers, and thick rings on his long fingers. His hair was combed forward, Roman style. A typical freshman he was not.”He cultivated his eccentrically artistic lifestyle during his university years, establishing his trademark style of raccoon fur overcoats worn with tennis shoes, and a habit of attending every performance of the New York City Ballet (which he did from 1957 to 1982). His first book The Unstrung Harp (“Or, ‘Mr Earbrass Writes a Novel’”), about the horrors of the writing life, was published in 1953. After that, he published more than 100 more titles, usually in small hardback editions. His distinctive scratchy style of illustration and macabre humor lead to a cult following by the late ’60s.A very private person, Gorey was publicly perceived as cold, gothic, and eccentric. The back cover of his 1997 book The Haunted Tea-Cozy (“A Dispirited and Distasteful Diversion for Christmas”) quotes the New Yorker: “Many of Edward Gorey’s most fervent devotees think he’s (a) English and (b) dead. Actually, he has never so much as visited either place.” In fact, his friends (who knew him as Ted) describe him as chatty and personable, which comes across immediately in documentary footage shot in 1996.Gorey moved to Cape Cod in 1986 following the death of George Balanchine, the legendary choreographer of the New York City Ballet, and then into the 1820 house he called the Elephant House, now known as the Edward Gorey House, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. He filled his home with books and his unusual collections, and lived with as many as six cats at a time, whom he referred fondly to as his “people.” It was for their sake that he eventually dispensed with his habit of wearing fur coats. He worked in a tiny room under images by Matisse and Goya, and “an Indian sculpture of a tiger devouring a missionary” (almost certainly one of the sculptures made after Tipu’s Tiger), always writing his surreal stories first, illustrating with a slow and precise style, after.In 1994, he was diagnosed with diabetes and prostate cancer, but in the end, he died of a heart attack at age 75 on April 15, 2000. A portion of his ashes were held in an urn pending the death of his last two cats, so they may be buried together in the yard of the house. A documentary was made about his life, shot between 1996 and 2000.The museum supports Gorey’s interest in animal welfare (he left his estate to three animal welfare groups in his will), as well as displays objects related to his life. The house has been cleared and rearranged since his death. Pictures taken by Kevin McDermott in the week after his death show piles of books and objects-on-objects. Most of his book collection was removed to make way for display items. Some things have been left as is, such as his cat-shredded divan, and his raccoon coat is in a display case.Forming a macabre scavenger hunt, there are are scenes from The Gashlycrumb Tinies, one of his most famous morbid books recounting the grisly deaths of 26 youngsters in 13 rhyming couplets, hidden throughout the museum. According to some accounts, there is a door at the back of a closet that leads to a secret room that once held his collection of children’s books.","Eclectic collections, artwork, and some feline friends fill the writer's former home. ","Whydah Pirate Museum,Scargo Tower,Cape Cinema ","8 Strawberry Lane Yarmouth, Massachusetts, 02675 United States",41.7054,-70.2422,Annetta BlackfineartdailymischchiefPrestonWEricaInCAMandrewPatinkinseemalkarthikEricaInCAMandrewPatinkinSSandstormfineartdailymischchiefPPrestonWmmbison,2010-01-10 00:00:00,"Cape Cinema ,Whydah Pirate Museum,Scargo Tower,Sandwich Boardwalk","Cats Museum,Lucky Cat Museum,Kuching Cat Museum,Museo de Anatomopatología (Museum of Pathological Anatomy)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/edward-gorey-house

With its brown walls, chandeliers emitting soft light, and display of beautiful Delft plates and tiles, the eatery offers a warm, welcoming place for a hot drink or stellar slice of apple pie. But beneath its comfy exterior lurks a hidden history of religious resistance.During the Dutch Protestant Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries, the government outlawed Catholicism. As a result, Catholics had to worship in secret. This led to the establishment of hidden churches, some of which still exist today. Our Lord in the Attic, for example, is a beautiful, 150-seat chapel, complete with pillars, a giant painting of Christ’s baptism, and a marble-and-gilt altar, all tucked away in (you guessed it) an attic.In Amsterdam’s Jordaan neighborhood, worshippers once secretly entered a church through a tunnel that ran beneath the canal. That tunnel opened at the building that houses Cafe Papeneiland, and it can still be seen today. The cafe’s very name is a nod to this history: Papeneiland means “papists’ island,” referencing how the building was a sanctuary for Roman Catholics, who were also known as “papists” due to their allegiance to the Pope. Today, the cafe is most well-known for its apple pie (or “tart,” depending on where you’re from). The fame is  deserved: The pie has a flaky crust, the perfect balance of tart-sweet apples and cinnamon spice, and a light-yet-rich tuft of whipped cream on the side. Order a slice, then ask your server to point you in the direction of the tunnel’s entrance. It’s behind a green-barred gate along the stairs to the basement. Sometimes obscured by brooms and other cleaning supplies, this doorway to the past can be easy to miss.","Famed for its pie, this eatery has a hidden tunnel that allowed Catholics to secretly walk to church during the Reformation. ","Tiny Hidden Houses on Westerstraat,Huddesteen,Pianola Museum","Prinsengracht 2 Amsterdam, 1015 DV Netherlands",52.3805,4.888,Sam OBrien,2019-11-18 00:00:00,"Huddesteen,Tiny Hidden Houses on Westerstraat,Pianola Museum,De Poezenboot (The Cat Boat)","Manchester and Salford Junction Canal,Bell Inn Caves,Caverns Grotto,'Catacombs' of Petrovaradin Fortress",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cafe-papeneiland

It’s so serene, you’d be forgiven for forgetting you’re in a bustling train station, surrounded by commuters dashing around to catch their trains.This verdant garden was inaugurated in 1992. It fills an abandoned section of the building that was once the old Atocha train station before the transportation hub was expanded to include its high-speed train links. The sprawling garden contains 7,000 plants from more than 260 species.In the arboretum section, you’ll find many plants native to tropical forests. Here, you’ll wander among breadfruit and coconut trees from Polynesia, royal palms and mahogany trees from Cuba, rubber trees from Brazil, banana trees from the Philippines, critically endangered palm bottle trees from the islands of the Indian Ocean, and an impressive traveler’s tree from Madagascar.The plants in the garden’s lower section are also originally denizens of the tropics and include African coffee plants, Central American cacao plants, and South American Heliconia flowers. A few stranger plants such as carnivorous plants, the Mexican fruit salad plant, South African bird of paradise flowers, and the endangered Ginkgo biloba plant from Japan can also be found growing here.The water lily ponds used to be home to numerous North and South American freshwater turtles that were former pets. After the turtles were abandoned by their owners and thrown into the wild, biologists rescued them from Madrid’s waterways. Instead of treating them as invasive species and euthanizing them, the biologists gave the turtles a second shot at life and set them up in a fancy new home within the garden, where they wouldn’t cause any harm to members of the native Iberian ecosystems. However, in the spring of 2018, the turtles were relocated to a nearby wildlife park due to overcrowding and overpopulation of the ponds. ",A lush indoor jungle fills this bustling Madrid transportation hub. ,"Real Jardin Botanico,The Giant of Extremadura,'Día y Noche' (Day and Night)",24B Calle de Méndez Álvaro Madrid Spain,40.4068,-3.6912,Monsieur MictlansanpricaXavixavirpoppyoanaseanjobstreley250sanpricaXavixavirttenc49rraveninareley250Luis Moratopoppyoanaseanjobst,2019-01-29 00:00:00,"The Giant of Extremadura,'Día y Noche' (Day and Night),Real Jardin Botanico,Panteón de Hombres Ilustres (Pantheon of Illustrious Men)","Allan Gardens Conservatory,Jardin du Tripot,Delta Sensory Gardens,Asticou Azalea Garden",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atocha-station-tropical-garden
658,Site of the Woolworth Lunch Counter Sit-in,"activism,civil rights,protest,racism,black history,museums,history",368,924,"Sit-ins protesting racist policies throughout the American South weren’t uncommon by 1959. There had been several across the South in response to the policy of segregated lunch counters, so the now-famous sit-in at the Woolworth department store’s counter in Greensboro, North Carolina was by no means the first. It was, however, a catalyst. This protest, which lasted five months, sparked other movements for racial justice across the country. Today, the protest is memorialized at the International Civil Rights Center and Museum housed in the former Woolworth building. For the four Black university students at Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina, the question wasn’t if they were going to stand against discrimination, but when. “At what point does a moral man act against injustice?” recalled Franklin McCain, one of the “A&T Four,” in a 1977 oral history of the sit-in. That point came on February 1, 1960. The four students—McCain plus Joseph A. McNeil, David L. Richmond and Ezell A. Blair Jr.—all freshmen at the university, had become close during their first year of college, and often spent nights talking about the ways they could challenge the nation’s racist policies. The night before their historic act, the men had challenged each other to turn talking into action, and the plan was formed. The men entered the store in the late afternoon, purchasing merchandise in the store before heading to the counter. They went to the lunch counter, sat, and then ordered, knowing that this simple act of ordering coffee and doughnuts could mean personal harm. The four students were, as expected, denied service but they stayed seated at the counter until the store closed. When they returned to campus, they recruited other students to join them in another protest. The next day, the four returned this time with nearly 30 more students. The group sat at the Woolworth’s counter from 11 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon, quietly sitting un-served while being shouted at by white patrons. The next day more than 60 students came to protest, the day after that, nearly 300, each day a new refusal, a new threat of violence and arrest. By the end of February, sit-ins had spread to more than 30 cities in eight states. When the protests ended on July 26, 1960 with the desegregation of the Woolworth’s counters, more than 70,000 people had participated in sit-ins across the country, and more than 3,000 people were arrested. This one protest in small-town North Carolina was a significant moment in civil rights history, and paved the way for many of the decade’s fights for racial justice.The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which opened in 2010, preserves the story of the the A&T Four and the thousands of civil rights heroes, named and unknown, who fought for equality in the United States. The museum has kept part of the historic counter in the space (part of it was sent to the Smithsonian), so that visitors will “never forget the courage displayed by four young North Carolina A&T State College students.”In remembering the first day of the protests, McCain said, “Nothing has ever happened to me before or since that topped that good feeling of being clean and fully accepted and feeling proud of me.” ",This North Carolina store preserves a historic moment in America's movement for racial equality.  ,"Elsewhere Collaborative,Charlotte Hawkins Brown Museum,Hoggatt House","134 South Elm Street  Greensboro, North Carolina United States",36.0717,-79.7907,AshawntajfurrMartinleslipetersonmariazeppetella,2017-11-08 00:00:00,"Elsewhere Collaborative,Charlotte Hawkins Brown Museum,Hoggatt House,High Point Chest of Drawers","America's Black Holocaust Museum,Liliesleaf Farm Museum,Riel House,Andrew Young Crossing",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-of-the-woolworth-lunch-counter-sitin

Betwixt the bottles are esoteric items that bring to mind a cabinet of curiosity, like diagrams of hot air balloons and antique magnifying glasses. The ceiling is papered with an old map, and the entire bar (all 13 square feet of it) feels like a secret speakeasy.  The bartender mixes on a tiny countertop complete with a camp stove. The night’s menu is tailored for the guests. Their ingredients are top shelf, with over 60 rare whiskeys alone, and drinks are served with classy, old fashioned flair. The Bahamas is served in a retro tiki glass, while the Guatemalan Diamond comes in a gem-shaped glass served atop a pile of smoking roasted coffee beans.Whether leaving BackDoor 43 after two hours of private speakeasy relaxation or just walking away from the window with a paper cup of liquor in hand, you’re sure to be left with a lingering sense of wonder in the small things.Update June 2020: The restaurant has reopened for take away from 7 p.m.","One of the world’s smallest bars, just 13 square feet, is brimming with speakeasy flair. ","Pantelegraph ,The Wall of the Dolls,Horned Madonna of Portinari Chapel",43 Ripa di Porta Ticinese Milan Italy,45.4513,9.1734,SteResogreggc80sitetron675massimiliano20097SchwegMolly McBride Jacobson,2017-05-04 00:00:00,"Horned Madonna of Portinari Chapel,The Wall of the Dolls,Pantelegraph ,The Devil's Column","Detective Bar Progress,The Tonga Hut,The Signal Box Inn,The Ten Bells Pub",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/backdoor-43

But the shell is actually hollow, made out of metal (painted white), and supported like an iron-framed skyscraper. The tight space between the exterior facade and the interior walls contains a stairwell with 365 steps.Up at the tip-top of the dome the stairs lead to a small room known as the Tholus. This round lookout spot is the vertical projection you see in between the circular bit of the dome and the Statue of Freedom. The government has released several photos over the years from the Tholus looking out, but there’s only one mysterious photo floating around (from Wikimedia, of all places) that shows the interior of the Tholus. Based on architectural plans from the 1860’s, it’s  a simple affair, but it would still be interesting to catch a glimpse.The familiar present-day structure is actually the Capitol building’s second dome. The original so-called Bulfinch Dome was smaller, made of wood and clad with copper. Work began on the second, more vertically gifted dome in 1855 and was completed in 1863 during the American Civil War. Iron was selected as the building material because it was fireproof, as well as cheaper and lighter than stone.The interior of the dome was once open to the public, but according to the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, “so many persons collapsed and had to be carried down, and so much trash was tossed below, that the area was closed.”",The walls of the iconic dome are hollow and have a secret stairway. ,"District of Columbia Center Point,The Portrait Monument,Philo Farnsworth Statue","U.S. Capitol Building Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.8898,-77.009,Elliot CarterAFstephenpohlGreg JonesDave Dusseau,2017-03-02 00:00:00,"District of Columbia Center Point,Philo Farnsworth Statue,The Portrait Monument,Senate Corncob Capitals","Capitol Building Tunnel System,Architect of the Capitol Archival Warehouse,Old Stone House,Missing Capitol Building Cornerstone",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inside-the-capitol-dome
661,Elfin Forest,"ghost stories,mythology",329,922,"In what seems to be a concentration of urban legend and tall tales, this fantasy-soaked forest is located in the unlikely demographic of sunny San Diego.Also known as “Questhaven,” the area is rumored to have once been inhabited by gypsies at the turn of the 19th century. Local legend has it that residents from neighboring communities came in and drove them off, slaughtering those who stood their ground. In turn, the surviving gypsies cursed the Elfin Forest and its surrounding lands.There is evidence that possible ancestors of the Northern Diegueno Native American tribes lived in the Elfin Forest area. Many artifacts have been found and efforts to preserve others are underway; mortars, metates, pictographs, and petroglyphs discovered there help shed light on the Yuman language they were known to have spoken, and contribute to a clearer understanding of their way of life which began more than 9,000 years ago.With its curving roads, twisting trees growing over pathways, eerie sights and sounds, and a total lack of cell phone reception, the Elfin Forest—thought to be haunted by superstitious locals —is the subject of dozens of urban legends. Many revolve around its abandoned, gated insane asylum, the entrance to which is marked by an old wooden fence and a sign with sleeping elves painted on it reading ‘Elfin Forest’. Behind the torn fence lie acres of land and decaying building foundations. Other tales of haunted spirits and paranormal activity attached to this area include trees that bleed, a ghost lady dressed in white that follows hikers throughout the trails, Native American bodies hanging from trees, shadowed figures that hide in the shrubbery, and other strange apparitions taking place over the rumored Native American burial grounds. With more than its share of myth and mystery, this wooded area is perfect for those with an active imagination and time to stroll through the trees searching for signs of ghosts and goblins.","This dark, quiet forest on the outskirts of San Diego is dense with rumor and lore. ","Heartbreak Hotel House,Queen Califia's Magical Circle,Copper Creek Falls and Mine","9419-9599 Harmony Grove Road Escondido, California, 92029 United States",33.0738,-117.1639,wmilamSallyinCaliAvoiding RegretRacheljondi letnapLampshade1660Lampshade1660SallyinCalijondi letnapkkhwebnaturedudeKKatieisawesomeAvoiding RegretRachel,2013-02-01 00:00:00,"Copper Creek Falls and Mine,Heartbreak Hotel House,Queen Califia's Magical Circle,Craftsmanship Museum","Golosov Ravine,Alux House at San Pedro Hotel,Diana and the Hounds Fountain,Risan Roman Mosaics",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elfin-forest

It’s thought to be one of the oldest castles in the country to have been continuously occupied by the same family, the other being Dunvegan Castle. Norman Keep, which was built primarily for defense rather than comfort, is now enclosed within a larger home that was completed around 1581.But its history isn’t what makes this castle stand out. In June 2007, after learning the entire concrete facing would need to be replaced, the building’s open-minded owners invited Brazilian graffiti artists to paint a large section of the castle’s outer walls.Painted by artists Nina, Nunca, and the duo Os Gemeos (“The Twins”—which the two artists, in fact, are), the contrast between the 16th-century building in the woods of Scotland and the 21st-century urban Brazilian graffiti creates an eccentric and delightful visual landscape.In addition to the castle itself, Kelburn Estate has a number of interesting natural features including waterfalls. Since David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow, was the Governor of New Zealand between 1892-97, a small museum was built on the estate to house a collection of artifacts related to both the Pacific island nation and the local culture. It includes farming equipment native to Ayrshire alongside Māori spears, taxidermied Polynesian birds, and kauri gum.

The newspaper relocated in the 1980s, and it seemed only fitting that the building then became Scotland’s Centre for Architecture and Design after extensive renovations, re-opening in 1999.Mackintosh designed the tower as part of a warehouse at the back of the newspaper printing office.

The abbey was slowly expanded and converted to stone materials across its centuries of use, experiencing fires and destruction from religious opponents, each time rebuilding the abbey a bit greater. At its height, the church complex was the largest and richest abbey in all of England, yet it was so large that it was also known to be in varied states of disrepair as no one seemed to be able to keep up the maintenance of the aging complex. It wasn’t until Henry the VIII ordered the dissolution of all monasteries in the 1500’s that the abbey finally shut down.   After the mandated abandonment, potions of the site were destroyed, but the majority remained and over the ensuing centuries, a water garden was built around the ruins which would become almost as famous. Despite the abandonment, the ruins ended up being fairly well-maintained thanks to its location in the Studley Royal Water Gardens, created by John Aislabie in 1718.  As a result, Fountains Abbey is the largest remaining abbey from its time and also the most well preserved.

The cave was a 80 meter hallway filled with gigantic selenite (gypsum) crystals up to two meters in length. Unfortunately the cave, 120 meters underground, was opened for exploration and eventually tourism, destroying many of the crystals.Ninety years later, two miners working on an excavation tunnel 300 meters below the Earth’s surface discovered another, much larger, cave. Here, the crystals measured up to 12 meters long (over 36 feet) with a single crystal weighing approximately 55 tons. These were the largest crystals that anyone had ever seen in the cave. The cave came to be known as the “Cueva de Los Cristales” or Cave of Crystals.Millions of years ago, volcanic activity filled the mountain with anhydrite, a waterless form of gypsum. As magma eventually cooled, the anhydrite began dissolving, enriching cave waters and allowing gigantic crystals to form. Amazingly enough, the size of the crystals has no limit and given enough time will grow to even larger proportions.The air temperature is 50C with a relative humidity of over 90%, making the air feel like 105C (228F). This makes it impossible for the body to cool itself.

672,Hitler's Olympic Village,"olympics,nazis,abandoned,history",182,921,"Little known to most tourists and even Germans, on the edge of Berlin lie the chilling abandoned remains of “Hitler’s Olympic village,” built for the so-called Nazi Games of 1936. It illustrates both the technical foresight and the ideological absurdity of the Nazi regime.Germany won the bid to host the 1936 Summer Olympics two years before the Nazi Party came to power. Initially hesistant, Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler then saw this as an opportunity to spread Nazi propaganda and build up Germany’s military machine.Hitler oversaw the construction of the Olympic village in Wustermark, on the outskirts of Berlin. In its heyday, the now-decaying complex included state-of-the-art dormitories, dining areas, training facilities, a swimming pool, and hosted some 4,000 athletes in luxury accommodations the likes of which had rarely been seen. Ironically, it was designed to portray an idyllic, picturesque image of a peaceful Germany to the world (the 1936 Games were the first to be televised). The Führer even named the complex the “village of peace,” with its layout resembling a traditional village and each hut named after a German town. However, the intention from the start was for the German army to use the complex once the Games were finished, and its design and construction were completely in the hands of the army.Hitler also tried to force anti-semitic politics on the event, lobbying to forbid Jews and black people from participating in the Games, though this hateful ploy failed as other nations threatened to boycott. In fact, despite this attempt to showcase the superiority of the Aryan race, the great American sprinter Jesse Owens won four gold medals that year. According to displays at the site, a fan wrote to Owens urging him not to accept the medal but the letter was intercepted by the Gestapo, who also listened-in on all telephone calls made by athletes from the village back to their home countries.During World War II, the Olympic complex was used as a hospital and training academy for German soldiers. In 1945 it was taken over by the Soviet army and used as a barracks for almost 50 years until 1994, after the fall of communism.  The Soviets repurposed the old swimming pool and training facilities for the likes of KGB interrogations, but also added sauna facilities to the swimming pool for their own soldiers. Where the village had once featured a mural of marching German soldiers, a painting of the Red Army was added, depicting Soviet soldiers planting the hammer-and-sickle flag on the German parliament.After the Soviets, the complex sat abandoned for years and fell into ruins. The old Olympic village was left largely untouched until around 2015, although vandalism and souvenir hunting destroyed most of the original artifacts.  The site remained relatively unknown even to citizens in Germany. A few athletic tournaments have been held at the site and efforts are underway to restore some of the complex into a living museum albeit with limited funding. One room has been fully restored as a reconstruction of the room used by Jesse Owens; albeit in the Meissner house – next to the actual house where he stayed.As of summer 2019, the western half of the crumbling complex is being developed into townhouses and apartments as Berlin’s population booms—including gutting of the original dining hall and conversion into residential apartments.",The 1936 Summer Olympics site is a crumbling remnant of sportsmanship and a history its host country would like to forget. ,"Alexandrowka,Spandauer Zitadelle (Spandau Citadel),Pfaueninsel","3-5 Zum Wasserwerk Wustermark, 14641 Germany",52.5366,13.0105,RachelSunMartinhrnickPartridgejanwoPPartridgejanwoSSunreley250MMaarten de LeeuwTTHC73mmechayakuzatylercolehrnickMMartinTTawsam,2016-07-28 00:00:00,"Spandauer Zitadelle (Spandau Citadel),Pfaueninsel,Alexandrowka,Bridge of Spies","Hotel Edén,Nevada Quicksilver Mine,Ruins Of Sheffield Ski Village,Sanquhar Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hitler-s-olympic-village

They generally have two cars that are counter-balanced, so one car goes up by the force of gravity pulling on the other car going down. And the up-car returns the favor by controlling the weight of the down-car.

674,Rose Island ,"abandoned amusement parks,amusement parks,abandoned",233,922,"Opened in 1923, Indiana’s rustic theme park Rose Island was a popular attraction for summer vacationers chasing after all manner of early 20th century fun, but the good times only lasted for a little over a decade when the park was destroyed by a flood, leaving today’s haunting ruins.The area once known as “Fern Grove” was already a popular recreation spot when entrepreneur David Rose purchased the land added some real attractions. Although the land is a peninsula, Rose renamed the area Rose Island to give it an air of exclusivity. Rose built a hotel, a swimming pool, and a wooden roller coaster in addition to a number of decorative flourishes. He also installed a tiny little zoo that held a wolf, some monkeys, and a bear named “Teddy Roosevelt.” People swarmed to the island in droves, arriving to the suspended foot bridge in their motor cars, or riding a steamboat to the “island’s” shore.Not even the economic downturn of The Great Depression hurt the booming Rose Island business. It was not until the Ohio River Flood of 1937 that the amusement park was finally abandoned. The flood drowned the facilities in 10 feet of water, and by the time they receded, the damage was too great to salvage and the site was abandoned.Today all that remains of Rose Island are the stone struts of its former footbridge, the swimming pool (which has held up remarkably well over the decades), and the crumbling remains of a stone fountain. After the original foot bridge collapsed, access to the grounds was restricted, but a new bridge was recently transplanted that allows access to the ruins. ",Ruined pieces of stone and a swimming pool are all that remain of an amusement park swept away by a flood. ,"Schimpff's Confectionery,Colgate Clock,Heigold House","12500 Indiana 62 Charlestown, Indiana, 47111 United States",38.4498,-85.6456,DanOCanMaps Memories MotherhoodAsehollyoriginalrkellsPartridge,2014-11-21 00:00:00,"Schimpff's Confectionery,Colgate Clock,Heigold House,Belle of Louisville","Wasa Graffitilandia,Abandoned Western Village,Kejonuma Leisure Land,Yongma Land Abandoned Theme Park",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rose-island

However, the many visitors might miss the most interesting part of the falls: the goby fish that literally climb up the wet rocks behind the falls to reach their spawning grounds.The northeastern coast of the Big Island is one of the wettest places on the planet, with the nearby city of Hilo receiving on average over 200 inches (5.1 meters) of rain a year. In the rainforest near the town of Honomu, ‘Akaka Falls State Park hosts a small loop trail that features views of the rainforest, culminating with the vista of ‘Akaka Falls with Kolekole Stream cascading 442 feet to the surface.While the descending water is an obvious nature attraction and well worth a visit in and of itself, sometimes things go up the rocks behind it. The less than three-inch goby fish called “o’opu alamao’o” (scientific name Lentipes concolor) live in the Pacific Ocean but spawn in the stream above the falls. The eggs are laid at the top of the falls and are washed back out to the ocean where they hatch and mature. When they are ready to reproduce, the fish head back to the falls. Using a special sucker on their underside, they climb up the rocks behind the falls to start the cycle all over again.

Concerned about dwindling food supplies, civic organizations worked to help Americans plant “victory gardens.” They would provide instruction, seeds, and plots of land for people to grow enough fruits and vegetables for their families and neighbors at a time when food supplies were unable to keep up with demand from both home and abroad.In Boston, across the street from another historic destination, Fenway Park, lies the Fenway Victory Gardens. Dating back to 1942, it boasts being the only remaining continuously operating World War II Victory Gardens in the United States.During the war, the Fenway Victory Gardens were created on a 49-acre spread ripe for cultivation. The official Fenway Garden Society was established two years later, in 1944, in an effort to provide land for those who wanted to continue growing their own food even after the war ended.Although much smaller than its original span, today the gardens cover 7.5 acres in Emerald Necklace’s Back Bay Fens along the Muddy River, an area designed by famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The Victory Gardens host 500 separate flower, vegetable and herb gardens, fish ponds and aviaries and are tended to by a diverse group of 350 community members and organizations. For visitors less interested in getting their hands dirty, the gardens also function as a park filled with community spaces for picnics, workshops, and wildlife spotting. The Fenway Victory Gardens are a living, working, growing piece of American history.For those with herpetological interests, the Fenway Victory Gardens are also home to the world’s northernmost known population—and the only known population of any lizard in eastern Massachusetts—the Italian Wall Lizard.

As the story goes, some rowdy Macleod men were visiting the island and got a little too handsy with the local women. Not about to allow this behavior to stand, the MacDonalds rounded up the rowdy rivals and set them adrift at sea. While the floating Macleods were eventually rescued this expulsion demanded a retribution.Clan MacLeod went on the warpath and decided to take the island by storm. The MacDonalds, getting wind of the coming siege, took the entire population of Eigg and led them into the secretive underground bastion called the Cave of Frances. The cave’s entrance was cramped and only allowed for people to enter a few at a time, before opening up later on down the path. Around 400 people in total were led into the cave. When the MacLeods could find no one on the island they began to depart, but spotted a careless lookout who gave away the location of the cave. Instead of storming the close quarters interior, the MacLeods instead covered the cave mouth with wet straw and lit it on fire. The Cave of Frances quickly filled with thick, acrid smoke, suffocating all 400 people inside. From that day on, the site was known as Massacre Cave. Human remains were found at the site for a number of years after the storied massacre, and today the cave can still be visited.

Above the green door, hovers a bright yellow umbrella and a sign that simply reads: Pep’s.

The upstairs of Pep’s Maison is a graveyard of broken umbrellas and replacement parts, but downstairs the shop features rows of finely made umbrellas for sale. According to Millet, umbrellas date back more than 6,000 years ago to China making the art—and it truly is an art—of repairing them one of the oldest jobs on earth. While Millet’s mission is to counter the wave of discarded umbrellas—many of which are not recycled—his shop is oft-celebrated for its nostalgia of a bygone era instead. The French government has classified Pep’s Maison as a Living Heritage Company, while the shop itself has started to gain something of a cult following from locals and tourists alike. At the end of the day, Millet’s hope is to give umbrellas a second life, seeing these everyday objects as something of sentiment.

However, they were delighted to discover hundreds more.Scientists have studied the prints and theorize that they were made by two different types of dinosaurs.

During the spring and autumn equinoxes, thousands of tourists and locals pack in around the pyramid to recreate the parties of a thousand years ago—sans the cutting out of hearts—and to watch the “descent of Kukulcan.” A carnival atmosphere fills the surrounding meadow with sounds of drums, traditional music, and cheering crowds.According to legend, twice a year when the day and night are in balance, this pyramid dedicated to Kukulcan (or Quetzalcoatl), the feathered serpent god, is visited by its namesake. On the equinox, Kukulcan returns to earth to commune with his worshipers, provide blessing for a full harvest and good health before entering the sacred water, bathing in it, and continuing through it on his way to the underworld.A handclap near the base of the pyramidal results in an unusual chirping echo, which is said to replicate the call of the sacred quetzal bird.All legends aside, crafty and mathematically brilliant architecture combined with the natural rotation of the Earth creates an amazing and somewhat eerie image of a giant snake crawling down the temple. For five hours an illusion of light and shadow creates seven triangles on the side of the staircase starting at the top and inching its way down until it connects the top platform with the giant stone head of the feathered serpent at the bottom. For 45 minutes this impressive shadow stays in its entirety before slowing descending the pyramid and disappearing along with the crowd that gathered to see it.The Pyramid of Kukulcan or Kukulkan (also known as El Castillo, a name given by the Spanish Conquistadors) is the centre of Chich’en Itza, it was built over a preexisting temple between 800 and 900 CE. It is the biggest pyramid in Chich’en Itza; at its base 53.3 meters wide on all four sides. It towers above the other monuments at 24 meters tall with a 6-meter temple on top of the highest platform. Before access to the throne room of the pyramid was restricted, you could climb to the top and, on a clear day, see the top of the grand pyramid at the nearby ruin site of Ek Balam.The Mesoamerican fascination with, and knowledge of, math and astronomy shines when examining the details of its architecture. Each of the four sides has 91 steps ascending it, 364 steps total, with the temple topping the pyramid considered an addition step totalling 365, each step representing a day in the calendar. Additionally, the pyramid’s nine stages, bisected by a staircase on each side, represent the eighteen months of the Maya Calendar year. The pyramid was built to be a physical representation of the Maya Calendar (the same calendar that predicts the end of the world in 2012), while its orientation, slightly North East, is believed to have been calculated in order to create the phenomenon know as the “Descent of Kukulcan”.This phenomenon is recreated nightly (artificially) during the Light and Sounds Show at 7 p.m. in winter and 8 p.m. in summer.Chich’en Itza is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The archaeological site features various structures that are grouped into major clusters. The most famous and visited cluster is the Great North Platform where besides the Kukulcan Pyramid one can find the Temple of the Jaguars and the Great Ball Court.",Every equinox this Maya pyramid puts on a spooky ancient light show. ,"Cenote Ik-Kil,El Caracol,Chichen Itza Chirp",Unnamed Road Chichen Itza Mexico,20.683,-88.5687,Treglenntube5mathewbrowneAnnetta BlackTeaAndCoffeeLovermbisongglenntube5mathewbrownelinkogeckoHDRGraceTeaAndCoffeeLoverMonsieur MictlanWWanderingGirlgabsterlambddanielhines04mmysticman57wwesfinksteverogers888JJasonWiinggabrieldiazJaszmina SzendreytthebinturongmmbisonAnnetta Black,2009-07-15 00:00:00,"Chichen Itza Chirp,El Caracol,Cenote Ik-Kil,Santo Domingo de Guzman Church and Convent","Ulupō Heiau,Santa Maria della Lode in Vescovio,St Ninian's Chapel,Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pyramid-kukulcan-chichen-itza

The valley stretches for 17 kilometers, and the cemetery contains almost 100 ancient stone crypts. Ossetians say that the cemetery helps them understand how people lived 400 years ago. Archeologists, also, are very interested in exploring the site more completely, as there have been interesting items found that have attracted some scientific attention.It is a very mysterious place with a lot of myths and legends. It was once believed that if anyone tried to get to the city they would never emerge alive. Local legends have it that in the 18th century a plague swept through Ossetia. The clans built quarantine houses for sick family members, who were provided with food but not the freedom to move about until death claimed their lives. People who did not have any remaining family members to bury them would just wait in the massive cemetery until their death. It was a very slow and painful way to go, and in the City of Death they stay.It attracts tourists from nearby as well as all over the world, although due to the difficulty in finding or traveling to the location there are not a lot of tourists at any given time. The local superstitions probably have little to do with the lack of popularity, although they do still linger. Locals bemoan the young generation’s attraction to bright cities, contending that the young are missing out on a lot. Russia has a lot of truly unique places to offer but these historic sites do not attract much attention. If, however, one spends some time in North Ossetia, they say it’s possible to feel the ancient vibes around the city and its surrounding area.Once you get to the city you will find what at first appear to be lots of little white houses but are actually stone crypts, the oldest dating back to the 16th century. In front of every crypt there is a well that was used to tell if a person made it to heaven. Visitors drop a coin into the well, and if the coin happened to hit a stone at the bottom of the well, it was said to be a good sign.",This ancient village and its adjoining cemetery have a beautiful history of death and remembrance. ,"Arshi Castle,Gveleti Waterfall,Gergeti Trinity Church","Unnamed Road Dargavs, 363128 Russia",42.8415,44.4452,ekoptevMartinBlindcolourMagnumPIOssaevaintegra,2016-10-11 00:00:00,"Gveleti Waterfall,Gergeti Trinity Church,Arshi Castle,Sno Giant Head Sculptures","Most Holy Trinity Cemetery,Portugal's Chapel of Bones,Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and Microminiature Museum,Cimitero Monumentale di Staglieno",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dargavs-village-city-of-the-dead

After purchasing the cement factory in 1973, Bofill transformed the eight spacious silos into a lofty interior for his workshop.The repurposed space houses everything from offices to libraries to the firm’s exhibition room, known reverentially as “The Cathedral.” Bofill himself resides within the factory. The grounds outside are carpeted by grass; eucalyptus, palm, olive, and plum trees grow in abundance. Climbing plants scale the various structures, lending La Fábrica the appearance of a lost industrial ruin—although nature’s seeming attempts at reclaiming the factory have been carefully encouraged by the hands of artists.The renovation draws its inspiration from the Catalan Gothic style, and also includes influences from other architectural languages. According to Bofill, while today the original cement factory has been successfully transfigured, La Fábrica will always remain an “unfinished work.” La Fábrica stands as a testament to the fact that any space can be reborn, and proves that an imaginative architect can adapt their art to even the most unexpected surroundings.",An architect transformed this abandoned cement factory into his castle-like workshop. ,"Espai Xavier Corberó,Castillo Torre Salvana,Walden 7","Av. de la Indústria, 14 Sant Just Desvern Spain",41.3813,2.0683,MiraMolly McBride Jacobson,2017-04-11 00:00:00,"Walden 7,Espai Xavier Corberó,Castillo Torre Salvana,Monasterio de Pedralbes","La Siberia,Sunnyside Conservatory,The Zwinger Gardens,Laurel Hill House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-fabrica-the-factory
693,Dungeon Rock,"will-o-wisps and spooklights,caves,ecosystems",185,917,"In the 2,200-acre Lynn Woods Reservation in Lynn, MA, is a rock formation called Dungeon Rock. It features a cave dug by a man directed by ghosts to search for a pirate treasure. The story starts in the mid-1600s, when a pirate named Thomas Veale supposedly hid in a cave with his loot. He lived there for a while until an earthquake destroyed him and the cave. The formation became known as Pirate’s Dungeon, which over the years became Dungeon Rock.In 1852, a man named Hiram Marble bought it, erected a house and outbuildings, moved his wife and son to the spot, and then excavated a new cave to find the treasure. Marble was a spiritualist and believed he was receiving directions to the treasure from the ghost of Thomas Veale himself. He held séances to receive digging directions, which he and his son Edwin undertook with dynamite and tools. They dug until their deaths but never found the treasure.Today, the cave they dug still exists and features an iron door open for a few hours each day during the warmer seasons or upon request from the local park rangers. To get to it, just follow the signs in the park. It’s set on a hill, and is accessible by a path. The rock itself is either two giant rocks abutting each other or a single rock with a giant crevice splitting it in two. The door is set inside that crevice. The cave is dark, wet, cold and a flashlight is needed to explore it. Thin wooden steps lead to the cavern floor, which then wends an erratic 135 feet into the rock before becoming too small to stand up in and ending in a small pool of stagnant water.Some remnants of Marble’s buildings still exist around the rock, including a couple of cellar holes and a fragment of wall. Near that fragment of wall is a large pink rock that marks the grave of Edwin Marble. Hiram is buried at Bay Path Cemetery in Charlton, MA.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W.

694,NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Atomic Clock,"astounding timepieces,long now locations,instruments of science",165,917,"If you’ve ever wondered what clock sets the official time of the United States, look no further. The bearer of that important standard is the NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Atomic Clock, located at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado. Built in four years, and officially established in 2005, the F1 is the latest in a series of increasingly accurate clocks responsible for keeping time for the entire country. The clock will neither gain nor lose a second in the next 80 million years.The process that the clock uses is, needless to say, extremely complex. Basically, it measures the frequency of microwaves needed to produce maximum fluorescence in a ball of cesium atoms. That frequency–the resonant frequency of cesium–is used to define the second. The “Fountain” in its title refers to the rising and falling of the ball of cesium atoms, which is produced by a group of lasers.This increased accuracy is not just a matter of idle dispute. The improvement in time measurement can aid advances in telecommunications, satellites and medical technology. It can also be used to obtain a greater degree of accuracy in scientific experiments where the tiniest measurements can make a huge difference–for example, determining the presence of fluctuations in what we perceive as constants of the universe.Update December 2018: Per the NIST website, neither the clock nor any other program at NIST, are open for public tours.",The clock that sets them all. ,"Boulder Teahouse,Media Archaeology Lab,The Architect's Daughter at First United Methodist","Boulder, Colorado, 80302 United States 40.0107, -105.2772Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyMedia Archaeology Lab0.10 milesBoulder Teahouse0.35 milesThe Architect's Daughter at First United Methodist0.63 miles",40.0107,-105.2772,Henryjfsefciksarahjanemeisel,2009-08-14 00:00:00,"Media Archaeology Lab,Boulder Teahouse,The Architect's Daughter at First United Methodist,Valmont Butte","Clock of the Long Now: Prototype 1,Long Now Orrery,Antikythera Mechanism,Eisinga Planetarium",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nist-f1-cesium-fountain-atomic-clock

The tides had shifted away from the emphasis the church once placed on death and damnation, especially after the high death toll on women and children in the Victorian era. People wanted to remember their dead in a loving manner, rather than a dark, depressing one.Inspired by the inviting greenery of Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London, Green-Wood Cemetery opened in 1838. It took advantage of the 478 acres of rolling hills and shady oaks, and offered Brooklynites a veritable park cemetery in which to visit their dead. Not only was it a peaceful spot for contemplation and remembrance, but it was also just a nice place to be amidst the grime of 19th century New York. People would plan day-long outings to Green-Wood, complete with picnics.The cemetery instantly became a coveted place to spend the afterlife. Hundreds of New York’s famous and infamous are buried at Green-Wood. Just a few of the most notable interred include William and Henry Steinway of piano fame, F. A. O. Schwarz of expensive toy fame, Samuel Morse of code fame, Leonard Bernstein of orchestral fame, Boss Tweed of corruption fame, and Louis Comfort Tiffany of stained glass fame—among many others. The grounds also boast some impressive monuments, including pyramids, mausoleums, and an intricately carved Gothic entranceway.Green-Wood is still a popular Brooklyn destination. It is equal parts park, cemetery, and historical resource. The cemetery conducts an extensive series of events (many with Atlas Obscura!), and makes its resources available to the public, including the undertakers’ ledgers. Green-Wood is still an active cemetery for burials and cremations (over 3,000 individuals are cremated there each year!).

The original party lasted two weeks, and was attended by thousands of revelers, the highlight being the royal joust, which took place in the Marienplatz where the clock is now located.A couple of blocks away is the Hofbraeuhaus founded by Wilhelm V to meet his needs for brown ale, the first brewery in the city. Lavish wedding as beer aside, Duke Wilhelm V was also known as a militant Catholic leader who took increasingly drastic measures both of personal piety and of public anti-Protestant policy. Under his leadership Bavaria became known as the center of early counter-reformation actions, including the final expulsion of Catholics from Bavaria and numerous witch hunts - a legacy which continued after his death by his son Maximillian I.On the lower portion of the glockenspiel, coopers (barrel makers) twirl through their famous Schäfflerstanz. According to tradition, the Schäfflerstanz, or Cooper’s Dance is tied to the end of a 1517 plague when the local coopers lured the frightened residents back out into the streets with some foot slapping dancing. The details may be apocryphal, but Munich did indeed suffer a terrible plague in 1635 which wiped out about a third of the population. Considered one of the last original guild dances in Germany, the Schäfflerstanz is traditionally reenacted by live dancers every seven years during the festival of Fasching, coming up next in 2012.At the end of the show, a small golden bird chirps from the top of the glockenspiel. The whole show lasts about 15 minutes.A relatively recent addition to the ancient town square, the glockenspiel was built in 1908 as part of the second half of building on the gingerbread Gothic-revival New Town Hall. Amazingly, the building escaped major damage during the heavy bombardment during WWII which left other buildings nearby roofless. A 2007 renovation apparently left the carillon out of tune, but it has since been remedied.The show starts daily at 11am, with additional shows at noon and 5pm in the summertime, lasting 12-15 minutes long.

But in the western half of this segment, seemingly unannounced, lies one of the kitschiest stops on the Mother Road.Hackberry General Store, located in the former mining town of Hackberry, Arizona, is bypassed by many Route 66 travelers, oftentimes because they simply blink and miss it. Unannounced by signage and isolated in the middle of desert, this hidden gem may be driven by countless times, but those who have decided to pull in know it to be a must stop for all Route 66 travelers.Nicknamed the “Mother Lode of Mother Road Memorabilia”, the Hackberry General Store is packed wall to wall with historic signs and artifacts. It also features a root beer bar and an internationally recognized shelter dog (best known for its spot on Harley Davidson and United Airlines commercials). The exterior of the general store is just as quirky. Historic Pegasus gas pumps, rusted-over Model As from the early 20th century, and a red ‘57 Corvette are scattered across the general store’s facade. A walk around will take you to animal head skeletons, a yellow “jack rabbit crossing” sign, and five original Burma Shave signs.Hackberry General Store was once a lifeline for a few dozen people. In 1874, when silver was discovered in the area, the town of Hackberry was founded, home of “shooting, fighting, and faro.” The town grew in 1882, when a railroad was built through Hackberry, allowing ranchers and miners to export their products further than ever before. Unfortunately, the nearest place to find groceries, gas, and other needs was Kingman, a full day’s drive in a Model A. Although it only served a small community of workers, the Hackberry General Store was a vital resource for the town.Unfortunately, Hackberry lost its main draw and nearly became a ghost town in 1919, when the Hackberry Silver Mine was closed down. However, it was revitalized a few decades later, when Route 66’s path crossed directly through town.

700,Titanic Memorial,"titanic,disasters,shipwrecks,ships,memorials,sculptures",464,1038,"A slim granite figure stretches its arms out towards the D.C. waterfront, an arresting figure with an air of mystery. It sits at the end of an out-of-the-way promenade at the northern tip of Fort McNair, and its placement seems almost accidental. Get close enough to read the inscription and the plot thickens: “To the brave men who perished in the wreck of the Titanic - April 15 1912. They gave their lives that women and children might be saved.” So how and why did a Titanic memorial end up here, in this quiet corner by a Washington army post? The short answer is, it didn’t start out here.The Titanic Memorial first lived further north, in a coveted spot along the Potomac. At the southern end of Rock Creek Park between Georgetown and the Lincoln Memorial, the statue first stretched those elegant arms out towards the city, with the wide river flowing just behind. It was unveiled in 1931 by Helen Herron Taft, widow of William Howard Taft who had been president at the time of the sinking.The figure had been chosen in a competition, restricted to female artists, sponsored by a group who called themselves the Women’s Titanic Memorial Association. It’s about 15 feet tall standing on a wide granite base, and was designed by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. She was not only an artist but a prominent socialite patron of the arts, benefitting from the double wealth whammy of being a Vanderbilt and marrying a Whitney.Her design was chosen in 1914, two years after the disaster, but it took almost 20 years to collect the funds—which they did not from Whitney, but mostly from small dollar-by-dollar donations. (Ironically, by the time it was paid for and unveiled, it was the same year Gertrude founded the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.)The memorial held its original ground until 1966, when it was removed as part of the plans to build the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Once knocked off it pedestal, the piece languished in storage for a couple of years, re-emerging in 1968 where it now stands. And sadly, where hardly anyone ever sees it.There are lots of Titanic memorials, collections and museums around the world, and you can check some of them out here.

701,Vashon Island Bike Tree,"natural wonders,plants,nature",269,915,"A rusted, dated bicycle is suspended inside the trunk of a tree, roughly 7 ft. off of the ground. It’s as if the towering giant had tried to absorb or “eat” the two-wheeler and quit, defeated halfway through the process, leaving the bike carcass suspended within the living wood forever.There are many stories and just as many questions about how the bike ended up in its awkward predicament. A boy tied it to a tree before going off to war, never to return. A child chained it there and got busy growing up, so the tree took it into an embrace. Artist, cartoonist and author Berkeley Breathed, who grew up on Vashon Island, wrote his version of what happened in a children’s book called Red Ranger Came Calling, weaving it into an elaborate Christmas story.While many are enchanted with the tree and its strange captive, some think it’s a hoax. Many have speculated that there is no way the tree could have “picked up” the bicycle if it had been left leaning against it on the ground, as trees do not, by nature, grow up from the trunk, but from the top. The less cynical have pointed out that since the bike seems to be from the 1910s, the tree could have easily been a sapling, and a forked branch may have been weaved between parts of the bike and lifted it up over the decades.Either way, the bike remains, suspended inside the knotted wood, and is a popular stop for hikers and bike lovers alike.","A bike being ""eaten"" by a tree is the real Vashon legend behind popular children's book, ""Red Ranger Came Calling."" ","Dune Peninsula,Untitled (Johnson Pit #30),Landmark on the Sound ","20304 Vashon Hwy SW Vashon, Washington, 98070 United States",47.423,-122.4601,RachelMagnumPIcaseyhentorivashonsierra28dklimke,2012-02-27 00:00:00,"Landmark on the Sound ,Untitled (Johnson Pit #30),Dune Peninsula,Big Top Curiosity Shop ","Enchanted Forest,Gryteskogen Troll Trees,Neskowin Ghost Forest,Cenote Ik-Kil",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vashon-island-bike-tree

Grant's Tomb,"presidents,tombs,monuments",1053,915,"In New York City, walking up the steps of Grant’s Tomb fills visitors with a sense of national pride and awe.Finished in 1897, 12 years after Grant’s death, the tomb rises 150 feet to a domed top that overlooks the Hudson River, honoring and holding the remains of the 18th American president and victorious Civil War general. On the facade of the tomb is inscribed a quote attributed to Grant: “Let us have peace.” Inside, Grant and his wife Julia are interred in a pair of massive red granite sarcophagi housed in a subterranean chamber. It’s the second largest mausoleum in the Western Hemisphere.The tomb was devastated by a long period of neglect starting when the National Park Service gained control of the site in 1958. Lacking a formal plan for the tomb, and in the midst of New York’s economic downturn of the 1960s and 1970s, the tomb was marred and scarred with graffiti and vandalism and its exterior nooks and crannies were a popular haven for drug dealers and the homeless. A grassroots rehabilitation effort gradually took hold starting in the early 1990s and today the tomb has been restored to its former glory.Grant’s Tomb is perhaps best known as part of a riddle: “Who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb?” The correct answer to the trick question is “nobody.” The remains of both Grant and his wife are entombed in their sarcophagi aboveground. Nobody is buried in Grant’s Tomb.",Visit the monolithic tomb of America's most famous general. ,"Rat Rock in Morningside Heights,Site of Columbia University's Nuclear Reactor,Amiable Child Monument","122nd and Riverside Drive New York, New York, 10025 United States",40.8134,-73.9631,Oliver Hongdlc31723icatsstaciJeff NewmanMark CaseyJordan646ccait7911JJordan646dlc31723icatsstaciJeff NewmanMark Casey,2012-02-25 00:00:00,"Amiable Child Monument,Site of Columbia University's Nuclear Reactor,Rat Rock in Morningside Heights,Tom's Restaurant","William McKinley Memorial,President William Henry Harrison's Monument and Tomb,President Warren G.

Humanity is celebrated in the square’s Court of All Nations.  You can walk through the Bell tower and Ring of Thanks, which is a 14-foot ring made of aluminum and gold that symbolizes gratitude.The Chapel of Thanksgiving is the spiritual center of the square. Inspired by the Great Mosque in Iraq, the spiral-shaped chapel explores unity while representing the diversity of different faith and traditions. The aptly named Glory Window has a spiral ceiling that contains one of the largest horizontally mounted stained-glass windows in the world.  It was designed by French artist Gabriel Loire in his workshop in Chartres, France. Loire intended for its progression of colors to express life with its difficulties and its joys all culminating to a point of light at its center.Visitors from all faiths are welcome to enter the chapel, which also hosts intimate prayer services, concerts, weddings, and special events.

706,Steinert Hall,"subterranean,subterranean sites,music,abandoned",203,913,"Hidden four-floors below a Boston piano store, Steinert Hall was once one of the most revered stages in the city before changing fire codes forced the subterranean theater to go under. At one time, Boston was known for, among other things, its piano manufacturing and it was during this time that a German immigrant and his family established the M. Steinert & Sons piano store and its amazing hidden performance space, Steinert Hall. The ornate concert hall was originally opened in 1896 as a space where the ground floor piano store could show off their wares. The space quickly gained notoriety in the area due to its fabled, near-perfect acoustics earning the underground concert hall the nickname, “Little Jewel.” The main recital space was small by concert hall standards but still managed to attract the finest classical musicians and opera performers of the day. Unfortunately, 1942 would prove to be the year the music died when the hall was forced to close due to restrictive new fire codes as a result of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire. Rather than pay for prohibitively expensive upgrades, the theater simply closed its doors, leaving the space empty but intact.Steinert Hall still rots away, untouched and unused deep under the Steinert piano store. It seems to be used as storage for broken or abandoned pianos, adding to the mouldering look of faded opulence. Visitors are not generally allowed into the decaying hall, and employees in the surface-level store are markedly reticent to discuss the space, but some high-profile touring musicians such as Elton John have been known to check out the grand old hall.  ",The former locus of Boston's high culture has been shuttered and buried for over 70 years. ,"Edgar Allan Poe Square,Chow Manderien's Grave,Central Burying Ground","No.162 Boylston Street Boston, Massachusetts, 02116 United States",42.3523,-71.0668,EricGrundhauserMtnLadyMartinkathymulliganickaimpdhouse,2012-12-16 00:00:00,"Edgar Allan Poe Square,Central Burying Ground,Chow Manderien's Grave,Folk Americana Roots Hall of Fame","Crystal Palace Subway,Clifton Cliff Jail,Jhaishan Tunnel,Water Tank Beneath Palais Garnier",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/steinert-hall

But in 1753, as Savannah revealed itself to be a port town, it was decided the botanical garden was no longer needed and this structure was the start of the Pirate House Inn, where it’s rumored seamen and pirates alike drank and shared stories of their adventures at sea.The modern-day restaurant was established in the early 1950s and welcomes Savannahians and tourists alike to enjoy an extensive southern-inspired seafood menu, served by waitresses in full pirate garb in one of the 15 separate dining rooms.

708,The Marconi Conference Center ,"cults,radio,hotels,abandoned",127,913,"The Marconi Hotel is a fascinating, yet nearly-forgotten piece of radio history nestled in the hills near Marshall, California, that was built to house Marconi employees, but ended up acting as a clubhouse for a new age cult. Guglielmo Marconi, often credited as “the inventor of radio”, hired J.G. White, a New York engineering company, to design and construct the structures at the historic Marshall trans-Pacific receiving station in 1913 and 1914. Along with his radio receiving station, Marconi created a luxurious hotel for his staff and their visitors. There were two cottages for the chief engineer and the assistant, an operations building, and a powerhouse for electric transformers and batteries as well. However the imposing hotel with its wide veranda was the centerpiece of Marconi’s receiving station. In addition to its thirty-five rooms, the hotel boasted such comforts as a library, game room, lounge, and dining hall. With the onset of World War I, the transmitters were taken over by the military and the hotel was used to house them. This intervention helped break Marconi’s hold on worldwide radio transmissions, and the grounds were briefly given over to the RCA company. Finally, in the early 1960s, a rehab facility known as Synanon took over the site. At first they were simply a drug and alcohol rehab center, but by the 1970s they had taken to calling themselves an “alternative lifestyle community” before finally becoming the “Church of Synanon” in 1975. Allegedly, leaders in the church began demanding some odd practices of their members, including that all the women shave their heads and that the men receive forced vasectomies. By 1980, the church was under suspicion for hoarding weapons and the leader was charged with attempted murder, essentially shutting down the organization.The Marconi grounds were subsequently given to the state who turned the land into the Marconi Conference Center State Historic Park. Today, the hotel has been renovated and reopened as a museum and visitors center.","Built by the inventor of the radio, this abandoned hotel has housed early radio employees, military men, and a dangerous cult. ","KPH Maritime Radio Receiving Station,1906 Earthquake Fence,Point Reyes Boat","18500 Shoreline Hwy Marshall, California, 94940 United States",38.1443,-122.878,JeffBRyshilihrnicksavsavsavAbandoned California,2014-11-12 00:00:00,"Point Reyes Boat,KPH Maritime Radio Receiving Station,1906 Earthquake Fence,Point Reyes Lighthouse","Abandoned Hotel Evropa,Cape Eleuthera Resort Ruins,Witch's Hat Pavilion,Abandoned Hotel at Cala d’en Serra",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-marconi-conference-center

Their grey stone effigies were uncovered in 1857 and excavated over the following decades.Petrified trees are not uncommon. Once buried in volcanic ash and deprived of oxygen, over a period ranging from a hundred to hundreds of thousands of years, the organic materials that make up organic matter, like trees, are replaced by silica. The resulting stone fossils retain all of the markings of the original trees, including bark, rings, and knots, and lie exactly as they fell millions of years ago. Petrified forests have been found all over the world, but the forest in Calistoga is remarkable for the sheer size of the enormous redwoods preserved, some thought to have been as old as 2000 years when they were felled. They are among the largest petrified trees found anywhere.The property has changed hands many times over the decades since its discovery, but it is still a small family-run operation. In the 1880s Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about his visit to the forest and its eccentric owner in his book The Silverado Squatters, and there is now a tree named for him along the trail. The height of the forest’s notoriety and excavation work was started in 1914 under the guidance of Ollie Bockee, whose publicity efforts included sending a log off to the city of New York and getting another log included in the wonders on display at the San Francisco Pan-Pacific Exposition of 1915.Today, about a half mile of trail wanders though the woodland with signs and markers indicating specific tress, some of which are only half excavated.

Although a lot of the evidence of their existence has been destroyed or lost, some sites still remain. In a Denver, Colorado, suburb, you’ll find one of these fascinating historic sites: a cave once frequented by a man named Colorow.Colorow was born to the Comanche Nation in the early 1800s, but was kidnapped by Muache Utes as a boy. As a young man, his new family began migrating from northern New Mexico up to northern Colorado, where he later married three sisters, Recha, Siah, and Poopa. After marrying, he became a prominent Ute leader and had 13 children.He led his people to hunt and camp in the west Denver area between present-day Morrison and Golden along the Dakota Hogback ridge. When in the area, they would stay in a cave in what’s now the neighborhood of Willowbrook in Morrison. It’s also said that he sought solace in the cave during hard times in order to reflect.Although relations with settlers started amicably, they deteriorated quickly. On September 2, 1878, his son Tabernash was killed by a member of a sheriff’s party. When the United States government began falling short on their promises, Colorow did not forget. His people were involved in the Meeker Massacre and the Battle of Milk Creek. It all came to a head in Colorow’s War of 1887, the final conflict between the first peoples’ of Colorado and ever-encroaching settlers. After Colorow and his people were forced off their land and onto reservations, he died in 1888 of depression and pneumonia.Colorow’s cave is a little slice of beauty and peace. With the surrounding mountains, meadows, and creeks, it’s no wonder Colorow had such an affinity for the area. With the cave open to the sky and it’s warm, protecting sandstone walls, you can understand how Colorow could have found peace there in such difficult times.",In the middle of a suburban Denver neighborhood is a cave that once provided solace for a prominent Ute chief and his family. ,"Tiny Town and Railroad,Bradford House II,Walker Mansion Ruins","6006 Colorow Dr Morrison, Colorado United States",39.6079,-105.1749,Jenna Dolecekmbw1965jjacobson160,2018-10-05 00:00:00,"Bradford House II,Tiny Town and Railroad,Walker Mansion Ruins,Columbine Memorial","Ice Cave of Bixby State Preserve,Moqui Cave,Akiyoshido Cave,Hermit's Cave and Quaker Burial Ground",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/colorows-cave

This nearly 70,000 acre park draws close to five million visitors a year from the nearby metropolitan centers of New York City and Philadelphia, making it one of America’s most visited public lands. But the story of its creation is one marked by much sadness.In the mid-1950s, two back-to-back tropical systems devastated what was then known as the Minisink Valley. Ultimately, the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers decided that a dam on the Delaware River could stop similar floods from happening. The proposed Tocks Island Dam was to be one of the largest ever constructed in the United States. The dam, however, was never built due to environmental outcry and a dangerous proximity to a fault line.Yet the residents of the Minisink were displaced anyway. Through the implementation of eminent domain and condemnation, the American federal government forced the relocation of around 15,000 people, some of whom had familial connections to the Valley dating back hundreds of years.So what had once been a vibrant, bucolic region thus became the DWGNRA, and the farmhouses and barns and churches and schools of the Minisink that were not demolished, were left to rot.

Silver production boomed, second only to Colorado, and many small towns sprung up around the mines.One such silver mining locale was the town of Elkhorn, founded in central Montana in 1872. Unlike many of the mining camps of the time, which were primarily populated by single male workers, Elkhorn was a family town. At its height, it had around 2,500 residents, and was home to the usual Western boom town establishments: a school, hotel, church, and saloon. The town fell into decline around the turn of the century as silver prices dropped, and a diphtheria epidemic tragically killed many of the local children. It was abandoned in the 1970s, with only a handful of residents persisting into the 21st century. Today, the ghost town stands as Montana’s smallest state park, and what remains of Elkhorn is in varying states of preservation.The town’s main gathering places, Gillian Hall and Fraternity Hall, are fairly well-preserved and open for exploration.

First launched in San Francisco’s historic Mission District, Paxton Gate’s Portland location has evolved into an ever-changing exhibition of ethically sourced life, death, and natural history.While offerings vary from week to week as merchandise comes and goes, you might see a cobra-mimicking moth with a 12-inch wingspan from Java, Indonesia, then turn your head 90 degrees only to come face to face with a grinning antique human skull from a decommissioned medical cadaver. Around the corner, a smoky-purple amethyst crystal from deep within Brandberg Mountain, Namibia, rests just feet below an antique wall mount of an Alpine Ibex whose cloven hooves once deftly navigated near-vertical rock faces in the European Alps. The store’s compact size only adds to the sense of wonder as you explore every shelf, case, and cabinet in this curiosity-packed mini-museum.",Entering this curiosity shop is like stepping into a mad scientist's lab. ,"Portland Art & Learning Studio,Flutter ,Wishing Tree","4204 N Mississippi Ave Portland, Oregon, 97217 United States",45.5539,-122.6753,BuzzBlackSmithangied,2019-04-17 00:00:00,"Flutter ,Portland Art & Learning Studio,Wishing Tree,Albina Soul Walk","Curioporium,Dark Matter Oddities & Artisan Collective,The Terrorium Shop,ReGEN Haus",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paxton-gate-pdx

In what could have been an ill-advised business move, he began accepting antlers, horns, pelts, and other game trophies as payment for drinks.A skilled furniture maker, Albert would craft the trophies into chairs and tables, which were sought after by the likes of Kaiser Wilhelm. These went on to decorate the ceiling and walls of the bar, eventually coating it entirely. His wife, Emile, got in on this action as well; she would accept jars of rattlesnake rattles and then use them in decorative works of folk art.The Prohibition era could have proved disastrous for the Buckhorn Saloon, but the Friedrichs stayed afloat by charging admission to their ever-growing collection of curios. When alcohol was legal again, they doubled their income by officially opening as a twofold saloon and museum.Through several changes of ownership and one massive move to a more central location, the Buckhorn Saloon and Museum has remained a fixture of San Antonio’s tourism industry. It won’t be difficult to spot The Buckhorn from San Antonio’s riverwalk: The building is adorned with giant plaster heads of longhorn cattle, elk, and buffalo.Though it is billed as a museum of wildlife, the Buckhorn’s museum sports some impressive specimens, including a 10,000-year-old prehistoric elk. But the museum also sports a robust collection of oddities. There is a hall of taxidermy fakes, or gaffs, which boasts a “Manboon” and a Feejee mermaid that is equal parts monkey and fish.Other non-wildlife related items reside in the Texas Ranger Museum, part of the Buckhorn. Part of the exhibit includes a replica of San Antonio at the turn of the century, which contains a model of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow’s car, complete with bullet holes. The wax figure exhibit portrays important events in Texan history, with a little bit of dramatic flair.

Only ten feet wide and 30 feet deep, rumor has it that the Skinny House was built out of spite to block sunlight from the home positioned behind it, hence its other less friendly nickname: the Spite House.The rumors go on to say that the house was the result of a feud that took place between two brothers around the time of the Civil War. When one of the brothers returned from the war he found that his sibling had already built a large house on land which they inherited from their deceased father. Feeling that the house was too large, and his brother unfair in distributing the land, the house-less brother angrily built the Skinny House to intentionally block sunlight to his brothers house and ruin his brother’s view.Today, the Skinny House is privately owned as a residential home, and according to 2005 owners Jennifer Simonic and Spencer Welton “We had a party of 10 one New Year’s Eve, and when one person has to go to the bathroom, everyone has to move. Instead of doors, we have floors between each space… When guests stay over, we put a mattress down on the closet floor… Except for sleeping in the closet, they seem to like it.”",Narrowest house in Boston. ,"Copp's Hill Burying Ground,Memorial for Boston Light Keepers,Tomb of the Mather Family","44 Hull St Boston, Massachusetts, 02113 United States",42.3669,-71.0562,SofyGavincjklevermbisonJulius SpadamistoranJJulius SpadacjklevermmistoranGavinRachelmmbison,2016-08-10 00:00:00,"Copp's Hill Burying Ground,Memorial for Boston Light Keepers,Tomb of the Mather Family,Boston's First Street","O'Reilly Spite House,Pan House,Shelton McMurphey Johnson House,The Wood Cake House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skinny-house

When viewed from the exterior, the galleries give testament to the imaginative design of the structure. During construction, the galleries were used as a means of disposing tunneling soil into the valley below. Originally, each of the galleries had parking places to allow visitors to admire the views. But these are no longer available because of a number of accidents in the tunnel.The tunnel was constructed between 1927 and 1930, and is part of the Zion–Mount Carmel highway, the length of which is included in the National Register of Historic Places. When the tunnel was built between 1927 and 1930, it was used to help minimize the visual impact of the highway, which was intended as a direct route between Zion, Bryce Canyon, and the Grand Canyon. The tunnel maintains a constant distance of 21 feet between the road center line and the face of Pine Canyon.When the tunnel was dedicated in 1930, it was the longest of its kind in the United States, though it has since been surpassed by the 2.5-mile Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel in Alaska.","A tunnel with windows, so you don't miss out on the impressive views. ","The Narrows,Checkerboard Mesa,Grafton Ghost Town","Zion – Mount Carmel Hwy Hurricane, Utah, 84737 United States",37.2113,-112.9582,Dr Alan P NewmanLiamYMichael Fousieglenntube5cl94Welbygglenntube5LLiamYbrian32768Michael Fousieccl94DDecadesinPreservationWelby,2020-03-13 00:00:00,"Checkerboard Mesa,The Narrows,Grafton Ghost Town,Coral Pink Sand Dunes","Rifle Sight Notch,Covão dos Conchos,Boolboonda Train Tunnel,Seikan Tunnel ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zion-mount-carmel-tunnel

A Detroit-based writer, Lund was obsessed with magic, but learned early on that he didn’t have what it takes. Instead of embarrassing himself as a failed magician, Lund decided he would become the foremost student of magic history and collect everything related to the art that he could get his hands on.The separate research center for aspiring magicians and historians of magic includes more than one million archived pieces, including a 50,000-volume library.",Largest magic museum in the United States with more than half a million pieces of memorabilia. ,"Dr. J.H.

724,Lemp Mansion,"suicide,intriguing environs,eccentric homes,homes,ecosystems",584,910,"The story of the Lemp Mansion runs hand-in-hand with the story of German immigration and beer brewing in St. Louis. Johann “Adam” Lemp, a German immigrant, moved to St. Louis in 1838 and set up a grocery store in South St. Louis.By 1840 he was focusing primarily on brewing and selling beer. He formed Western Brewery, one of the first breweries to produce German Lager in the United States, at 37 South Second Street (where the south leg of the Arch now stands).Adam’s son, William J. Lemp, took over Western Brewery after serving as an  Orderly (First)  Sergeant for the Union in the American Civil War. Under William, the brewery grew to be the largest in St. Louis and the largest outside of New York with a single owner.William “Billy” J. Lemp Jr., William Sr.’s first son, followed the same educational path as his father, however it was William Sr.’s fourth son, Frederick, born in 1873, whom William Sr. hoped to groom to run the company. In 1876, William and his wife, Julia, moved into the Lemp Mansion (built in 1868). William changed the company to William J. Lemp brewing company in 1892 with his son William Jr. as Vice-President and his son Louis as Superintendent. It was now a family affair.Unknown to the Lemp family, Frederick had significant health problems, and in 1901 Frederick died of heart failure. William Sr. became despondent and slowly deteriorated mentally and psychologically until he committed suicide by shotgun on February 13, 1904.Billy took over after his father’s death. His wife filed for divorce in 1908 charging Billy with desertion, cruel treatment, and other indignities. Billy was only granted visitation rights for their only son, William III. The company began to slide after prohibition, eventually shutting down and being auctioned for a minuscule fraction of its original worth. On December 29, 1922, Billy Lemp shot himself in his office. Today that office is the dining room of the mansion.William Sr.’s youngest child, Elsa Lemp Wright, married Thomas Wright in 1910 and filed for divorce in 1919. They reconciled and were remarried in 1920, but she shot herself while in bed on March 20.Charles Lemp, William Sr.’s third son, moved into the mansion in 1929. On April, 1941, Charles Lemp sent a letter to a south St. Louis funeral home requesting that in case of his death, his remains should be taken by ambulance to the Missouri Crematory. His body should not be bathed, clothed, or changed. His ashes should be put into a wicker box and buried on his farm. There were to be no funeral held or a notice put in the papers. On May 10, 1949 he shot his dog, then himself in the head, leaving the following note: “St. Louis Mo/May 9, 1949, In case I am found dead blame it on no one but me. Ch. A. Lemp”.That was the only suicide note in the family’s history.Edwin Lemp, the only remaining child of William Sr. (Louis died of natural causes in 1931), never moved back into the mansion. Edwin died in 1970 at age 90. His final order to his caretaker was to destroy his art collection and family heirlooms.Today, the Lemp Mansion has been made into a restaurant and inn by the Pointer family and offers tours (historical and haunted), murder mystery dinner theatre, and Halloween parties.",A historic house in St. Louis was plagued by a series of suicides committed by family members involved in a successful brewery. ,"Compton Hill Water Tower,Venice Cafe,Whispering Arch at Union Station","3322 Demenil Pl St. Louis, Missouri, 63118 United States",38.5932,-90.2158,salongmoreltellor42winonaRacheltahoff20976Collector of Experiences,2012-02-22 00:00:00,"Venice Cafe,Compton Hill Water Tower,Whispering Arch at Union Station,Burial Place of Chief Pontiac","Hermitages of Karoulia,McHenry Mansion,Nature Friends Tourist Club,Ganvie Lake Village",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lemp-mansion

Granted, the heavy advertising outside and hokey feeling that these spots inspire make it a bit easy to dismiss them as tourist traps, (which of course they are) but none of this takes away from the bizarre and delightful feeling of letting ones brain be hijacked by a perceptual con-artist.The story: According to the St. Ignace Mystery Spot, in the early 1950s a few surveyors were exploring Michigan’s Upper Peninsula one day when they realized that none of their equipment was working properly. The problems, they discovered after some testing, were only apparently in a circle about 300 feet in diameter. Behold: a mystery spot!Over the years, thousands of visitors have stopped at the Mystery Spot to experience a place where “gravity does strange things” (or more accurately, your brain does strange things as it tries to make sense of contradictory input) and tall people appear to be shorter than they do outside of the spot. These optical contradictions and odd physical sensations keep people coming back for more. It is also said that the Mystery Spot make people feel queasy and light-headed if they stay within the spots boundaries for too long.Capitalizing on the tourist attraction, the owners of the spot have installed other attractions. Now, visitors to the Mystery Spot can also take a guided tour, play miniature golf, explore a maze built in the woods, or take a ride down a zip line.The site was voted Michigan’s number one unusual attraction by the readers of Michigan Living magazine.",Strange physical sensations and optical contradictions keep visitors coming back for more. ,"Mackinac Island,The Wacky Taxidermy & Miniatures Museum,The Mackinac Bridge","150 Martin Lake Road St. Ignace, Michigan, 49781 United States",45.8758,-84.808,Nicholas JacksonsoxndTourist07AFJAGExploresinfinitylimitedcorpPGor,2010-10-03 00:00:00,"The Mackinac Bridge,The Wacky Taxidermy & Miniatures Museum,Mackinac Island,Skull Cave","Mystery Craters ,Marcell Experimental Forest,Cerro de las Campanas (Hill of Bells),Guelta d'Archei ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-ignace-mystery-spot
727,Okanogan Highland Ghost Towns,"old west,gold,gold rush,mining,ghost towns,abandoned",126,908,"Scattered on the desolate plateaus of the Okanogan Highlands, a few miles south of the Canadian border, stand the quietly decomposing relics of pioneer homesteads. A handful of gold rush townsites persist as durable monuments from a bygone era of boom then bust mineral exploration that brought intrepid Chinese miners and later white settlers to this corner of the Old West.Frontier towns like Bodie, Chesaw, and Molson briefly thrived during the late Victorian era when gold was discovered in the rivers and creeks between the Pasayten Wilderness and the Selkirk Mountains. Mineral fever brought an enthusiastic and short-lived prosperity to the rugged Okanogan, but like so many other small towns on the edge of nothing, once the veins tapped out or became too expensive to extract, the communities dried up.Today what remains of these sites survive in quintessential ghost town form. From the agricultural hamlets of Tonasket and Oroville, lonely mountain roads climb several thousand feet into the Okanogan Highlands, transporting travelers into a time capsule of the Old West in slow decay. As the terrain levels out, old prospector cabins and abandoned mining equipment dot the landscape. On the cliff walls high above the old roadways, Native American petroglyphs quietly survey the landscape as they have for hundreds of years.The townsite of Molson, named after the Canadian brewing magnates who were early investors in the region still showcases its sturdy, stonework school house standing proudly in addition to the wood-planked Molson State Bank, which has managed to keep its original safe securely inside all these years. Nearly a dozen other wooden buildings in various condition remain scattered among the grassy landscape surrounding this former frontier mecca that boasted a population of 300 in 1899.Further to the southeast at the mouth of a small creek lie the skeletal remains of the Bodie townsite. In 1902, the Wrigley brothers invested some of their chewing gum fortune in a mill here, establishing a mining epicenter on the Okanogan Highlands. For several decades Bodie thrived, unlike many of its neighboring communities, which rarely lived to see both sides of a decade. Eventually the nearby veins ceased to yield quality ore, and by the 1940s the town fell quiet. Today you can park your car in the middle of Main Street and try to imagine how these ghostly buildings, barely existing on the edge of wilderness, were once the focus of heavyweight, industrial icons.",This former mining hub holds a surprising abundance of undisturbed relics from the Old West.  ,"The Ghost Town of Phoenix,The Spotted Lake (Kliluk),Nk'Mip Cellars","Molson, Washington, 98844 United States 48.9811, -119.1994NearbyNk'Mip Cellars11.33 milesThe Spotted Lake (Kliluk)17.89 milesThe Ghost Town of Phoenix28.74 miles",48.9811,-119.1994,John HiegerCDVV86,2019-05-07 00:00:00,"Nk'Mip Cellars,The Spotted Lake (Kliluk),The Ghost Town of Phoenix,The Old Apple Warehouse","Fort Egbert,Chatanika Gold Dredge #3,Shakespeare Ghost Town,Cerro Gordo",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/okanogan-highland-ghost-towns

729,Vista House at Crown Point,"oregon,art nouveau,art deco,roadside attractions,architectural oddities,architecture",1307,908,"Sitting 733 feet above Oregon’s Columbia River, this 1918 Art Nouveau rest stop atop the Crown Point promontory celebrates the grandeur of the great American West with an elegance befitting the view.Portland architect Edgar M. Lazarus intended his extravagant two-story structure to stand as a “temple” to the natural beauty of the Columbia River Gorge. Built on the Crown Point promontory along America’s oldest scenic highway, the octagonal “Vista House” still serves as a place where travelers can take in the view and wonder at the harrowing journey of the Oregon Trail pioneers.The spot also represents a kind of grand American merger of technological achievement and environmental preservation. Built from 1913 to 1922, the Columbia River Highway was a feat of engineering and civic mobilization. Its two visionaries, lawyer and entrepreneur Samuel Hill and highway designer Samuel Lancaster, saw the tourism potential in an increasingly car-owning population and proposed a major route that would draw visitors while maintaining the integrity of the landscape. Together they shepherded county, state, and federal efforts to build a state-of-the-art highway that remains one of the earliest examples of modern, cliff-face road building. It was Lancaster who suggested the addition of an observatory, citing the need for a resting place where travelers could view the river “in silent communion with the infinite.”With no state funding available, the project was paid for primarily by Multnomah County and partially by private parties, including funds raised by local schoolchildren. A notoriously expensive undertaking, Vista House garnered a reputation as “the million-dollar rest stop.” On-site historians still refer to it by this nickname, though records suggest that construction ran closer to $100,000. The grey sandstone rotunda borrows architectural elements from German Art Nouveau, with the interior decked out in pink Kasota limestone, rare Tokeen Alaskan marble, and finished with green-tinted, opalized windows to complement the green and honey-toned roof tiles. Considering the awe-inspiring location, it’s easy to see why Lazarus felt it was worth the splurge.",This extravagant Art Nouveau rest stop features a million-dollar view of the Columbia River. ,"Multnomah Falls,Beacon Rock,Chocolate Waterfall","40700 Historic Columbia River Hwy Corbett, Oregon, 97019 United States",45.5396,-122.2443,alexandracoakleyMartinmatthuckeCollector of Experiencestonyanrobjoedecker,2016-03-30 00:00:00,"Multnomah Falls,Chocolate Waterfall,Beacon Rock,Kelly Butte Civil Defense Center","Mark's Hot Dogs,The Beaumont Hotel,Turk's Head Building,Richfield Tower's Art Deco Doors",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vista-house-at-crown-point

Every inch of the wall has been filled with Lennon-inspired graffiti and Beatles song lyrics. It is a quiet, almost respectful space as visitors walk down the length of the beautifully painted wall. An image of John Lennon was first painted on the wall (opposite the French Embassy) after his murder in December 1980. Soon, it became a prime site for political and Beatles-inspired graffiti and a sounding board for disgruntled youth. Several attempts were made by the police to whitewash the wall, but in vain. Artists continued to paint on the wall, refusing to be pinned down.The wall is the property of the Knights of Malta, and after repeated attempts to keep the wall clean, they finally gave in and the wall now stands in all its graffitied glory. Visitors may even see someone working on the wall whilst you’re there. Often it is students keeping the tradition that began 40 years ago alive.Update as of October 2019: The wall has been covered by tarps and is undergoing renovations. The site plans to reopen as a gallery for professional artists.","Despite attempts by local police to discourage it, Beatles-inspired graffiti has been a means for artists to air grievances for decades. ","Location of Saint John of Nepomuk's Martyrdom,The Penguins at Kampa Park ,Museum of the Infant Jesus","4-6 Velkopřevorské nám.

In fact, some of its residents live, without much notice, on the top floor of the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum.As you turn the corner after arriving on that floor, the puppets from Fred Roger’s beloved Children’s Show, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, appear before you. These original puppets are King Friday XIII, Queen Sarah, Henrietta Pussycat, X the Owl, Lady Elaine Fairchilde, Daniel Tiger, and Grandpere.The Neighborhood of Make-Believe was a way for Rogers to talk about difficult topics in a way that children could understand and relate to. He performed many of the puppet personalities himself. They were part of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, which was one of the first children’s television programs aimed at helping children’s development. The show ran from 1963 to 2001 and was only off the air for one year (1967).The puppets aren’t the only Mister Rogers props within the museum. Others are sprinkled throughout its exhibits like little Easter eggs for both kids and kids-at-heart. On a bench in the “Attic” exhibit, under a plexiglass box, are Roger’s signature sneakers and a tiny plaque. Most people don’t know they’re there and pass right by. Outside of the “Makeshop,” a craft area in the museum, is Roger’s iconic red sweater.Though Pittsburgh is heavily connected to Rogers—the Pennsylvania native lived and died within the city—these exhibits are barely mentioned on the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum website and hardly appear in traditional tourist advertising, meaning these childhood treasures are basically hidden away in plain sight!",The residents of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe live without much fanfare within the Pittsburgh Children's Museum. ,"reCARstruction,Randyland,Photo Antiquities Museum","10 Children's Way Allegheny Square  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",40.4528,-80.0064,e1savageAFlizzievjm87999laurenmishgraf,2018-09-10 00:00:00,"reCARstruction,Photo Antiquities Museum,Randyland,Exposition Park Marker","Portland Puppet Museum,Museum of Childhood,Museum ENTER,International Clown Hall of Fame",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/original-puppets-from-mister-rogers-neighborhood

Today, it has been said, many of the instruments look like something out of a science fiction novel or movie.Used to teach the principles of chemistry, biology, and physics, the instruments held by the museum include anatomical models, botanical paintings and more. The majority of the pieces in the collection were purchased in London and Paris between about 1820 and 1850 and brought to the school to be used by students in the medical program.Two particular items of interest are the 14-inch-diameter hairball from the stomach of a buffalo given to the school by George Rogers Clark Todd, the youngest brother of Mary Todd Lincoln, when he graduated from the medical program; and a rare Medical Venus, a life-sized dissectible wax figure of a woman created by casting organs and tissues from as many as 200 cadavers.While the museum is open by appointment only, some pieces from the collection, judged by a visiting specialist from the Smithsonian Institution to be among the finest in the nation for the time period it represents, are on rotating display in the lobby of the Brown Science Center. ",Outstanding collection of 19th century medical instruments includes a life-size figure cast from as many as 200 cadavers. ,"Jim Varney’s Grave,Bondurant's Pharmacy,Dixie Cup Water Tower","Transylvania University 300 North Broadway Road Lexington, Kentucky, 40508",38.0527,-84.494,Nicholas JacksonPushingUpDaisies,2010-09-08 00:00:00,"Jim Varney’s Grave,Dixie Cup Water Tower,Bondurant's Pharmacy,Lexington's Biblical Miniature Golf","Greatbatch Barn,Kirkaldy Testing Museum,Scuola Grande di San Marco,Good Vibrations Antique Vibrator Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-monroe-moosnick-medical-and-science-museum-lexington-kentucky

A bronze statue of the worshipped feline dating back to 600 BC is one of the highlights of the American Museum of the House Cat, which has hundreds of exhibits dedicated to the beloved species.Founded in April 2017 by the local “Catman” Harold Sims, the museum focuses specifically on the house cat, the domesticated pet. The museum features cat memorabilia collected by Sims over three decades: A petrified cat rescued from a 16th century English fireplace, a hand-carved kitty carousel, antique cat toys, and cat beer steins are all on display. The retired biology professor and his wife Kay set up a no-kill cat shelter in 2002 right next door to their home in Sylva, North Carolina. The museum was conceived as way to share their vast cat-themed collection with feline lovers, document the history of human-cat interaction, and raise money for the shelter.

While the name in itself is an attraction, a trip inside the town yields even more quirks.Truth of Consequences was originally named Hot Springs after the dozens of geothermal spring-fed spas that came to dominate the town. By the late 1930s, Hot Springs was filled with 40 different natural hot springs spas—one spa for every 75 residents at the time. But then, to draw in even more tourists, the town took a bolder move. In March of 1950, the popular NBC radio show “Truth or Consequences” promised free publicity to the first American city to rename itself Truth or Consequences. Hot Springs decided to take up the offer, and after a citywide referendum voted in favor of the name change, was awarded the honors. The “Truth or Consequences” radio show was aired from Truth or Consequences on April Fool’s Day, 1950, a major event for such a small town.Since 1950, the radio host, Ralph Edwards, revisited Truth or Consequences every year for 50 straight years on the first weekend of May. Upon each visit, he was welcomed by a “Fiesta” of beauty pageants, parades, rodeos, rubber duck races, and the Hatch Chile Queen, a tradition that, despite Edwards’ death, is still celebrated today.Since the 50s, Truth or Consequences has been featured on multiple “unusual place name” lists and was even the site of the Doctor Who episode “The Zygon Invasion”, which based its plot on the city’s unique name. T or C, as it’s known to locals, has also used its unique name to its advantage for promoting its spas. Says a local resident, “it is the truth that we have the health-giving waters here. The consequences are that people get results.”Throughout the city, a variety of interesting sites can be found. The Geronimo Springs Museum, for instance, features old windmills, Native American art, and wooden figurines. The adjacent Las Palomas Plaza is a public park where you can dip your feet in rushing spring-fed water in a surreally designed setting, resembling the set of a Star Trek episode. Past the historic WPA-built downtown are murals, a bull statue, and a war memorial with an eagle standing atop a globe on one leg. Also found throughout town is a painted water tank, a wigwam, and a polka dotted bench reading “WET PAINT.” In fact, from the town’s visitor center, you can even take a tour of Spaceport America, the world’s first purpose-built spaceport, just 25 miles down the road.","This quirky hot springs town known to locals as ""T or C"" was named after a radio show. ","Lake Valley Historic Townsite,Sparky's ,Spaceport America","Truth or Consequences, New Mexico United States 33.1284, -107.2528Book a hotel on Kayak NearbySpaceport America18.71 milesSparky's 32.49 milesLake Valley Historic Townsite33.74 miles",33.1284,-107.2528,lewblankMolly McBride JacobsonCorpseLady84kymolsenicatsstaci,2016-09-06 00:00:00,"Spaceport America,Sparky's ,Lake Valley Historic Townsite,City of Rocks State Park","Terme Lucane,Marobo Hot Springs,White Sulfur Springs Ruins,Lithia Water Fountain",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/truth-or-consequences

737,Gravensteen,"torture museums,castles",957,908,"Constructed over the site of a much weaker looking wooden castle by a pompous count, the fairytale fortress known as Gravensteen became a house of torture and injustice from the 12th-century and was almost torn down later on due to the memory of those atrocities. While a much smaller castle existed on the site prior to the construction of Gravensteen, it was the ostentatious Count Philip of Alsace who created the lovely, if imposing fortress that remains today. The fort was originally constructed as a symbol of the power of the Count of Flanders, it was Philip, who had fought in the Crusades and seen a number of grand castles in his travels, who insisted that the walls and towers of the castle be built to such a height that their very presence would let everyone know just how much money and influence their position held. Gravensteen is often called the Castle of the Counts for this reason.Eventually, the counts abandoned their seat in the 14th century and the castle became simply a prison and courthouse. It featured multiple courthouses and subterranean dungeons in which criminals and accused simply awaiting trial were kept in unlivable conditions and frequently tortured.While the barbaric activities were abandoned as the area became more civilized in the ensuing centuries, the site never lost the taint of the horrors that were once perpetrated within its walls. By the end of the 1800s, the structure had become unsound and its reputation was doing nothing for it in the court of public opinion, thus Gravensteen was nearly razed.Luckily a preservation group realized the architectural and (however horrible) historical importance and managed to save the castle. Today, the site has been greatly restored still retaining a decorative moat on three sides, and is open to the public, even featuring a torture museum, possibly as some sort of mea culpa. Despite its grim past, Gravensteen is still one of the most stunning historic castles remaining in the world.       Update May 2019: As of May 2018, the torture museum no longer exists. There were some renovations carried out and the implements of torture are now reduced to a few remaining examples displayed behind a plexiglass barricade. ",This fairytale castle was built as a show of power but was nearly torn down thanks to its history of torture. ,"Volkssterrenwacht Armand Pien,The Flashing Streetlights of Ai Nati Oggi,'Jonas'",6-12 Sint-Widostraat Ghent Belgium,51.0575,3.7207,daanphoto24philoursmarshrnickharryjosephstevensCollector of ExperiencesLuis MoratohharryjosephstevensggoldylocksnnicoleweymannBalkanTuristCollector of ExperiencesLuis MoratoSEANETTAhrnickphiloursmarsBadAsh13,2014-09-22 00:00:00,"The Flashing Streetlights of Ai Nati Oggi,'Jonas',Volkssterrenwacht Armand Pien,Dr. Guislain Museum","Hume Castle,The Black Castle,Arshi Castle,Boyne Castle ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gravensteen-2

When Butler located the burro the next morning and picked up a rock to throw at the animal, he noticed the rock was exceptionally heavy—that rock turned out to be from the second richest silver strike in Nevada history. Tonopah suffered the typical booms and disasters that most mining towns do, but unlike many of its counterparts, it never emptied enough to receive ghost town status. It’s no metropolis, but it chugs along with a population a little over 1,200.

Some three hundred people are interred at the old location, including many of Tonopah’s pioneer residents, many of whom fell victim to the mysterious 1902 “Tonopah Plague”, the cause of which still remains a mystery. Other eternal residents include some fourteen miners who fell victim to the Tonopah-Belmont Mine Fire of February 23, 1911, among them Big Bill Murphy who died saving miners at age 28, and Nye County Sheriff Thomas Logan, killed in a shoot-out in a Manhattan bordello.Of course many believe that the cemetery is haunted, and interested parties should inquire with the owner of the Clown Motel which is next door - locally though, the Mizpah Hotel and Silver Rim Elementary School are thought to be more actively haunted.",There's nothing creepier than a cemetery next to a clown motel. ,"Tonopah Mining Park,The Mizpah Hotel,Clown Motel","521 North Main Street Tonopah, Nevada United States",38.0721,-117.2385,zackofalltradesNeighborhood SquatchDogMameg87RachelzydekoAbortionCribmmeg87DDogMaNeighborhood SquatchzydekoLouchebonvivantbbenmoresAvoiding RegretVVagabondRachel,2013-06-09 00:00:00,"Clown Motel,Tonopah Mining Park,The Mizpah Hotel,Paste Eater's Grave","Red Ash Island Cemetery ,Roslyn Cemetery ,St Michael's Church & the Nine Men of Madeley,Ballarat Ghost Town",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-tonopah-cemetery

Included among the latter is the Palau Mornau, a grand Renaissance-cum-modernist structure that now houses a museum—not of portraiture, or decorative arts, or even Catalan history, but of weed.The Palau Mornau was originally built in the 16th century as a city palace for the noble Santcliment family. Owned by the family for two centuries, the building was bought in the late 18th century by Josep Francesc Mornau (the “honorary war commissioner of the Royal Armies”) and later changed hands again in the early 20th century, coming under the ownership of one Joan Nadal de Vilardaga, the brother of the mayor of Barcelona.The new owner undertook a major renovation of the palace, transforming the building into a masterpiece of the Modernisme style that was changing the face of Barcelona at the time and continues to be a major architectural signature of the city. The renovation included stained glass windows, floral wrought iron balconies, a faux stone facade, and exquisite interior design that imparted every room with uniquely styled floors, ceilings, walls, and windows.By 2001, however, the building had fallen into disuse and disrepair, when it was a discovered by Ben Dronkers, a Dutch entrepreneur and philanthropist who had started Amsterdam’s Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum in 1985. Seeking to expand the museum’s facilities and mission beyond Amsterdam, he purchased the Palau Mornau and embarked on a ten-year project of meticulous renovation – a sensitive task, given the building’s status as a national monument. Once the restoration was completed, the Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum Barcelona opened its doors to great fanfare in May of 2012, with the grand opening featuring silver-maned real-life Tony Stark proxy and drug policy reform advocate Richard Branson. The museum’s permanent collection contains approximately 8000 objects related to cannabis cultivation and utilization throughout human history, including medicine bottles, apothecary kits, prescription bottles, paintings, pipes, sculptures, and film posters.

It quickly became the largest Texas Mission, and was often referred to as the “Queen of the Missions.” (Spanish missions were not churches, but whole communities, with the church at its core.)Mission San Jose’s inhabitants worked and lived there and completed the complex in 1782. Although the mission stopped operating in 1824, it baptized over 2,000 Indians.Today, Mission San Jose is still an active parish and holds open mass on Sundays.

As the story goes, his car broke down, and he was forced to make camp near the isolated roadside woods. Instead of just thinking of this excursion as a minor inconvenience, he fell in love with the spot and set up a permanent roadside stop-in that eventually grew up to be the current Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort.The site of Jussi’s breakdown has grown into a luxury resort destination which features a variety of interesting accommodations. There are cozy log cabins, some with built-in glass nooks to better view the surrounding wilderness and auroras. There are the snow igloos which are little ice hotels where visitors can get warm in a very cold place. And perhaps most astoundingly, there is the field of glass igloos which all look like little see-through geodesic domes where nothing can obstruct your view of the Northern Lights. The resort, sitting at almost the northern tip of Europe, seems like some sci-fi outpost built on the edge of the world to survive its collapse, but really it’s just a cozy little spot to enjoy the beauty surrounding it.",Rent out a glass igloo to watch the Northern Lights like you live in the future. ,"Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church,Treriksrøysa,Siida Museum","19 Kiilopääntie Saariselkä, 99830 Finland",68.3335,27.3367,akornblatthrnickerjefferycandielynnaribrown,2015-10-19 00:00:00,"Siida Museum,Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church,Treriksrøysa,HaliPuu's Campfire Barista","Hotel del Coronado,Hotel Pušynas,Sun City Resort,Bedford Springs Resort",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kakslauttanen-arctic-resort
745,Dismals Canyon,"bioluminescence,natural wonders,plants,nature,animals",222,905,"Past twilight this Alabama canyon comes alive, lighting up with hundreds of tiny bio-luminescent creatures known colloquially as “Dismalites.” These “glowworms” – actually a type of gnat larva – require a very specific habitat to survive and are unique to only a few places on Earth. They are related to the bioluminescent fungus gnats found in Australia and New Zealand.Taxonomically known as “North American Orfelia fultoni,” the Dismalites are the larval stage of the only bioluminescent member of Diptera (the “fly” order, containing mosquitoes, gnats, midges, and houseflies) found in North America. An endemic species, they live only in the Appalachian Mountains and Cumberland Plateau, and emit a bright blue-green light to attract food, in the form of other flying insects.In its larval stage the dismalites requires a very specific habitat to survive: humidity to prevent it from drying out; hanging surfaces to allow it to build sticky webs to trap the food; an adequate food supply of insects; a still atmosphere to prevent lines from tangling; and darkness to allow it to show a light. It so happens that Dismals Canyon provides the perfect habitat for these unique insects to survive, and when looking up at the moss-covered canyon walls it’s hard to tell where the Dismalites stop and the stars begin.The dismalites aren’t the only curious part of Dismals Canyon. Until an ice storm destroyed one of them, twin Canadian Hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) towered up from the canyon floor. One of them remains, towering 138 feet tall, 8 feet and 9 inches around and with a crown spread of over 50 feet, it looks quite sturdy and healthy for its age of 360 years. It is the largest of its species in Alabama and thought to be one of the largest anywhere in the world.The hemlock is in an isolated spot hundreds of miles distant from their normal range of growth. It is believed the twins were the sole remnants of boreal or subarctic flora pushed south during the age of glaciers. The Canyon is also said to be home to the world’s largest Deumaria vine.To see the dismalites buy a ticket for a night tour and bring a flashlight with a red filter on it. ","Famous for its bio-luminescent inhabitants, known as ""Dismalites"" . ","Rattlesnake Saloon,Key Underwood Coon Dog Cemetery,Alabama's Natural Bridge","Dismals Wonder Garden  901 Highway 8 Phil Campbell, Alabama, 35581",34.3286,-87.78,Facebook1234057031webwebsteripingupingnaturedudesnoweel,2010-03-31 00:00:00,"Alabama's Natural Bridge,Rattlesnake Saloon,Key Underwood Coon Dog Cemetery,Frank Lloyd Wright-Rosenbaum House","The Milky Seas,Tambopata Research Center,Synchronous Fireflies of the Great Smoky Mountains,State Darwin Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dismals-canyon

This experimental city was constructed in order to demonstrate how urban conditions could be improved while minimizing the destructive impact on the earth.

The current population varies between 50-150 persons, based on the number of students and volunteers on the site.The layout of the buildings is intricate and organic, rather than a typical city grid. The current structures include a five-story visitors’ center/cafe/gift shop, a bronze-casting apse, a ceramics apse, an outdoor amphitheater, a community swimming pool, an office complex, as well as a ring of apartment residences and storefronts. Arcosanti also maintains greenhouses, gardens, and agricultural fields.Construction continues as students from around the world visit in order to attend workshops and classes. Funding is aided by the sale of artistic bells, crafted onsite, and the 50,000 tourists that visit each year.Soleri, who was from Italy, enrolled in Frank Lloyd Wright’s school of architecture, one of which was located just outside of Scottsdale, Arizona.

On their one day off per week, these employees of slaughterhouses, railroad companies, lumber mills, and garment factories were known to enjoy two simple pleasures: the sanctuary of their local church and a nice cold beer.The 90-foot-tall bell tower, sturdy wooden doors, worn Chicago brick, and Gothic German script above the entrance to the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church date back to 1880, when it first opened to serve the community. Over the years, German residents gradually left the overcrowded Pilsen neighborhood, replaced by Bohemian, Polish, Eastern European, and other cultures.By 1956, the church had been abandoned by its original congregation. A devastating fire in 1979 destroyed the roof and interior, and a 1998 windstorm toppled many of the remaining walls. Owner John Podmajersky Jr. planned to demolish the building and redevelop the site. That all changed when, after hearing news of the windstorm, descendants from the church’s early congregants came to visit, bringing with them a German-language record of the church’s early history. Podmajersky, a longtime area resident whose family roots in Pilsen go back three generations, was reportedly so moved that he vowed to save the remains of the church.These days, the bell tower is topped by a modern skylight, the walls are restored and stabilized, and what was once the church’s interior is a now a quiet garden sanctuary. A badly burned crucifix hangs eerily from the inner wall, protected from the elements by a clear plastic shield.Podmajersky hasn’t moved forward on his supposed plans to convert the tower space into artist studios, but one thing is for sure: this Pilsen landmark is a bewitching testament to the area’s forgotten history.",One-of-a-kind preserved ruins of an abandoned 1880s church in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood. ,"Jane Addams Hull-House Museum,National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame,Bubbly Creek","826 W 19th St Chicago, Illinois United States",41.857,-87.648,Patti Swansonlusciousart312joevalesherjefferyjoelplusmeg,2018-04-13 00:00:00,"Jane Addams Hull-House Museum,National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame,Bubbly Creek,Rosenberg Statue ","Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea,Class of 1959 Chapel,St. John’s Church Cemetery,Swedenborgian Church",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zion-evangelical-lutheran-ghost-church

When geologists first discovered the frozen waterfall in 1911, they thought the red color came from algae, but its true nature turned out to be much more spectacular.Roughly two million years ago, the Taylor Glacier sealed beneath it a small body of water which contained an ancient community of microbes. Trapped below a thick layer of ice, they have remained there ever since, isolated inside a natural time capsule. Evolving independently of the rest of the living world, these microbes exist in a place with no light or free oxygen and little heat, and are essentially the definition of “primordial ooze.” The trapped lake has very high salinity and is rich in iron, which gives the waterfall its red color. A fissure in the glacier allows the subglacial lake to flow out, forming the falls without contaminating the ecosystem within.The existence of the Blood Falls ecosystem shows that life can exist in the most extreme conditions on Earth. Though tempting to make the connection, it does not prove, however, that life could exist on other planets with similar environments and similar bodies of frozen water—notably Mars and Jupiter’s moon Europa—as such life would have to arise from a completely different chain of events.Even if it doesn’t confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, Antarctica’s Blood Falls is a wonder to behold both visually and scientifically.",Natural time capsule containing an alien ecosystem. ,"Don Juan Pond, McMurdo Dry Valleys,Shackleton's Antarctic Hut",,-77.7167,162.2667,matthewwarrenleesajeevadamNicholas Jacksonmichellesirpsaalmeida41CJ HendersonsajeevLeslie McIntyreatimianRRickNicholas JacksonssirpsNNilzeFFacebook1132474015mmbisonwythemichelleadam,2011-08-05 00:00:00," McMurdo Dry Valleys,Don Juan Pond,Shackleton's Antarctic Hut,Pegasus Wreck","Lake Natron,Mono Lake,Koyashskoe Salt Lake,Salt Ponds of San Francisco Bay",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blood-falls

It would have parked outside one of the then-functioning textile mills in Biddeford, Maine, when each shift let out. The barrel-roofed, stainless-steel car would have bulged with row after row of exhausted workers eager to stifle the day’s hunger. They would have lined up behind one another as each finished their toast, eggs, and bacon on one of the diner’s 15 stools. Today, the mill is a converted workspace, but people still line up to eat at the same diner every day.The Pollard Company car, known as the Palace Diner, was built in 1927.

Ownership has changed hands six times since the last Roaring Twenties. Its most recent exchange may have been its most pivotal. Current owners Greg Mitchell and Chad Conley have earned this locally celebrated and quietly historical diner national acclaim. With stints in both high-end kitchens and highly regarded farms, the pair have applied their culinary prowess to the humble world of diner food.

754,Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore,"dunes,cliffs,beaches,lakes,legends,water",1171,901,"Stretching 35 miles along the northwest coast of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakefront encompasses 50,000 acres of unique “Third Coast” terrain, including the evocative dunes after which the park was named. If you spend any time in Northern Michigan, you’ll likely hear about this Great Lakes landmark, as well as “The Legend of Sleeping Bear.”In the legend, a mother bear and her two cubs are forced to swim across Lake Michigan from Wisconsin after lightning sparks a forest fire. The mother bear encourages her young cubs to keep swimming through the night, but when she finally makes landfall in Michigan, she finds that the cubs have fallen far behind and cannot be seen. She climbs to a high bluff overlooking the water, where she falls asleep waiting for them. As she sleeps, the wind blows many layers of sand over her, forming a large dune atop the lakeside bluffs that looks like a sleeping bear. The Great Spirit then raised two islands within sight of the “mama bear dune” to commemorate the bravery of the cubs and the devotion of their mother.The “perched dunes” of the federally protected lakeshore sit atop the steep cliffs towering above the coastline and were formed by the same glaciers moving south from Canada that carved the Great Lakes. Unlike more familiar shoreline dunes, perched dunes sit atop a plateau; wind and water erode the plateau, creating sand and gravel that is then blown to the top of the rise to form dunes. The Sleeping Bear Plateau contains a dune field roughly five miles long that was formed in this manner.As far as things to do in and around the park, the Dune Climb is a popular challenge. It’s a 3.5-mile rollercoaster of a hike from the base of the dunes to beautiful blue Lake Michigan. For those who are up for a more difficult, less encouraged challenge, there’s always the 450 foot, very steep part of the dune near the Empire Bluff Overlook. It’s not illegal, just ill-advised. This part of the dune is currently eroding at a pace of about a foot per year (in part because of people climbing it), and is supposed to have been part of a peninsula that once extended two miles into Lake Michigan.Sleeping Bear Dune National Lakefront was voted “The Most Beautiful Place in America” in 2011 by viewers of ABC’s Good Morning America, and it is much beloved by Mario Batali. For the record, there are bears there that are awake on a regular basis — black bears to be specific — as well as the occasional cougar, so campers should be vigilant.",This national park on the shore of Lake Michigan features remarkable dunes that lie at the heart of a Chippewa legend. ,"Wreck of the Francisco Morazan,Manning Memorial Lighthouse,The Rising Sun Shipwreck","6748 S Dune Highway Glen Arbor Township, Michigan, 49636 United States",44.8825,-86.0411,AaronNetskyRHyzer,2016-05-12 00:00:00,"Manning Memorial Lighthouse,The Rising Sun Shipwreck,Wreck of the Francisco Morazan,Holy Rosary Catholic Church","Silver Lake Sand Dunes,Lac Salé,Maiden's Sand Path of Kizkumu Beach,Lake of Cutilia ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sleeping-bear-dunes-national-lakeshore

Some might be disappointed to learn that the plane is no antique at all, but actually a replica modeled after a 1916 British Sopwith Camel. Also disappointingly, it didn’t arrive at the roof by way of a dramatic landing, but was instead placed there by crane in 1969, a year before the building was officially opened for business. The candy store below is likewise a replica, albeit a functioning one.According to Robert Kaufman, president of the New York real estate developer the William Kaufman Organization, the plane was conceived as a way give the folks in nearby condos and offices something interesting to look at. The candy store at 77 Water Street was incorporated into the lobby as part of Kaufman’s goal to humanize his building.

The town was split on whether to let the fast-food chain do this, but ultimately gave the go-ahead. It opened in December of 1984. The restaurant retained its style, which the Freeport Historical Society describes as “a mix of Greek Revival and Italianate architecture.” One could walk in and think that this was just a local posh tavern, like the one across the street. However, this restaurant doesn’t serve fine steak and craft beer; it serves Big Macs and Coca-Cola.While it is not the only literal McMansion in the United States (there’s another in New Hyde Park, New York), it is nonetheless unusual.","When the town wouldn't allow the fast-food behemoth to build a new restaurant, they put one inside an 1850 home. ","Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum,Eartha,The Desert of Maine","11 Mallett Dr Freeport, Maine United States",43.8603,-70.1017,bendboyCheryllionCollector of Experiences,2021-07-15 00:00:00,"The Desert of Maine,Eartha,Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum,Bailey Island Bridge (Cribstone Bridge)","Batumi McDonald's,Mark's Hot Dogs,McDonald's Imperial ,Biltmore McDonald's",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcdonalds-freeport-mansion
758,Musical Parking Garage,"aletrail,installations,sounds,music",449,901,"In most parking garages, the mystery is figuring out where you parked your car. The delight is remembering. But the 7th Street Parking Garage in Charlotte offers very different mysteries and delights. “Touch My Building” is an “urban musical instrument” by American sound artist and architect Christopher Janney, who works at the intersection of architecture and music. Some of his pieces are performances, some are installations, but most of them defy easy categorization. Many of them require a human element, like his master’s thesis project “Soundstair,” which uses photoelectric sensors and a sound sampler to make music as a person walks or dances along a set of steps.“Touch My Building” was designed to encourage pedestrians to take a break and interact with their surroundings. It’s massive in scale, coating nearly the entire exterior of the nine-story parking building. The garage is covered in transparent blue and purple rectangles, connected to 36 30-foot-tall red fins. When the fins are touched, they light up and play music. But the building also has a mind of its own. Different tunes play automatically every hour and a “ghost” in the building will sometimes trigger random performances. (Janney says that this last feature allows the building to properly engage passersby in conversation. It’s saying hello.)The trickiest, but most rewarding, way to converse with the “ghost” is to solve a puzzle. A plaque mounted on the side of the building lays out a riddle. If you are able to solve it, you get quite the show. ",This nine-story building can be played like an instrument. ,"Wall Poems of Charlotte,McGill Rose Garden,Freshlist's Seasonal Produce Clock","298 E 7th St Charlotte, North Carolina United States",35.2278,-80.8378,hanalydiasee,2017-05-13 00:00:00,"Wall Poems of Charlotte,McGill Rose Garden,Freshlist's Seasonal Produce Clock,VisArt Video","Vlissingen Wind Organ ,The Wave Organ,Ciderville Music Store,Memphis Gong Chamber",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/musical-parking-garage

Larkin, founder of the Salada Tea Company, to celebrate his industry’s storied past.In 1927, these elaborate doors were installed at the Salada Tea Headquarters in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood. The Toronto company was founded in 1892, by Larkin, who sold the first tea packaged in foil, thus paving the way for the modern tea bag. Salada was so successful that the company eventually moved from Toronto to Boston in 1917, into a custom building designed by the architects Densmore and LeClear.The doors were designed by sculptor Henry Wilson and feature ten panels telling the story of the exotic origins of tea. They depict scenes including Ceylonese famers harvesting, sorting and drying tea leaves, workers transporting tea boxes on their heads, elephants carrying tea boxes, and tea being loaded onto ships. The outer doorframe, carved by artist Caesar Caira, includes pilasters of stylized Asian women, a frieze featuring elephants, and high-relief statues of Demeter, goddess of the harvest, with her children.

Since at least the 10th century the local population has been taking shelter in the large cave in which the temple now sits, usually hiding out from attacks from marauding enemy tribes. Remains of these earlier uses of the cave were uncovered when the temple was built in 1828 at the behest of the reigning pope. A crude hermitage was also installed right near the entrance to the temple. The ornate design features a domed roof covering an octagonal silo structure meant to symbolize Jesus’ resurrection after three days.The isolated mountain temple is known as the “Refuge of Sinners,” and acted as a pilgrimage site for those seeking forgiveness. The interior originally held a marble Madonna and Child sculpted by Italian artist Antonio Canova; however, the original has been moved to a local museum and a replacement was installed in the temple. While the idiosyncratic hidden temple is more of a tourist attraction than a site of solemn prayer, the shrine inside is still a religious site kept in good order.        ",This domed temple was built in a hidden cave mouth as a refuge for sinners seeking absolution. ,"Casa di Scuretto ,Basilica of the Mummified Saint Ubaldo,Fontana Dei Matti","Tempio del Valadier Parco Naturale Regionale Gola della Rossa e di Frasassi Genga, 60040",43.4338,12.9428,EricGrundhauserseldorMartin,2015-03-03 00:00:00,"Casa di Scuretto ,Basilica of the Mummified Saint Ubaldo,Fontana Dei Matti,Mount Ingino Christmas Tree","Myouryuji (Ninja Temple),Muzey Sulayman Too,Lincoln Memorial Undercroft,El Nido de Quetzalcóatl",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/temple-of-valadier

Together with his wife he set up a number of public sculptures, including Chicago’s Batcolumn sculpture. The spoon was Oldenburg’s idea, who had a habit of doodling spoons ever since 1962 when he was inspired by a spoon resting on a piece of fake chocolate. The cherry in the piece was van Bruggen’s idea, wanting to use it as a comment on the garden’s otherwise staid layout.The spoon itself weighs 5,800 pounds and the cherry, another 1,200 pounds. The cherry’s stem also acts as a fountain which sprays into the bowl of the spoon and off into the pond beneath. Even the pond itself has meaning, being shaped to resemble a linden seed, drawing attention to the rows of linden trees planted nearby. The city of Minneapolis seems to have largely embraced the massive sculpture, expressing almost universal outrage when Spoonbridge and Cherry was vandalized in 2012 as part of a “Kony 2012” protest.

Originally designed to accommodate about 200 patients, it was expanded to alleviate overcrowding in 1899 and eventually was home to as many as 1,500 patients.When it was founded, many hoped the hospital would be a source of restorative treatment, rather than a costly dumping ground where those suffering from mental illness could be kept away from the rest of society. But as the hospital grew, patient welfare was increasingly set to the side. Tasks around the hospital were done largely by labor from the patients, and treatment consisted largely of sedation and time in Turkish baths.Plans to close the hospital were put in motion in the late 1980s, and the main unit was shut down in 1995.The hospital has been vandalized and looted since its closing, and plans had been made to demolish the historic building to make way for 280 new homes and businesses, but these were never completed.

764,Austin Moonlight Towers,"electrical oddities,retro-tech",960,900,"“The baying of bloodhounds frantically seeking the killer’s scent broke into the usual chorus of Yuletide merriment, chilling holiday spirits.” - Austin Statesman, Christmas 1885In the wake of a series of horrific murders, the city of Austin purchased 31 enormous towers to light the city streets from on high. The 165 foot towers cast a glow “bright enough to read a watch by” in a 1,500 feet (460 meter) radius around each tower. Despite early concerns about plants growing out of control - Day of the Triffids style - and animals never sleeping, the towers quickly became beloved symbols of the city and have defied the odds of the years with 17 of them lit nightly still to this day.In 1884 the population of Austin was just about 23,000 people. Although other cities had begun the process of electrification - usually starting with individual installations in posh houses or government buildings with independent power generators - Austin remained lantern lit after dark. However this would change when over the next year, the city was shaken by a series of late night murders.After the deaths of two women the killer was named the “Servant Girl Annihilator” by the local press, who covered the crime scenes in grisly detail. By Christmas 1885 there were five women dead, three others injured, and no viable suspects. All of those attacked had been black women, and blame in the press was pointed squarely within the Austin black community. On that night two more women were killed, nearly at the the same time. Both were white women, at home with their husbands.On Christmas Day a panicked citizen’s meeting was held about the safety of their community. Police patrols were increased, and and the installation of electric “Moonlight Towers,” like some already in use in Detroit, was planned.The press and eventual trial of the husbands of both women murdered in Christmas were a media sensation in their day. One of the victims, Eula Phillips, was accused of moonlighting as a prostitute, and in the course of the trial the names of prominent Austin citizens were dropped as brothel clients. In the end, both husbands were let free - one by virtue of a hung jury, the other by appeal. As the Dallas Morning News put it, “The trial of Mr. Phillips has demonstrated three things: that Mrs. Phillips was not what she should have been, that several attachés of the government are not what they should be, and that no one can possibly know who committed that murder.”Curiously, the murders stopped after that Christmas night.The towers were purchased second-hand from Detroit and were not actually installed until 1894 long after the murders had stopped. They were first lit on May 3, 1895 in a gala celebration.Originally the 6 lamps were accessed via interior manually-powered elevators (which are still there) for maintenance of the carbon vapor arc lights, which had to be trimmed daily, they ionized the air around them and perhaps killed a few birds too. The lights were later swapped out to incandescent lights in 1920s, and then to mercury vapor in 1930s. In the 1940s a master switch was installed to allow the city to black out in times of emergency without having to climb each tower. A major restoration of the towers was conducted in 1993 in time for their 100 year anniversary.The 17 remaining towers are now a Texas state landmark, and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Each year the tower in Zilker park is transformed with lights into the “World’s Largest Christmas Tree.” They are now also the last moonlight towers in the world.",Turning night into day in Victorian-era Austin to thwart a serial killer. ,"Frost Bank Tower,Toy Joy,Museum of the Weird","W 9th St & Guadalupe Street Austin, Texas, 78701 United States",30.2717,-97.7452,Annetta BlackknoxiumLynnFacebook567422532exploringwitheschforssafforssamichaelamillerexploringwitheschknoxiumnotoriousFIGMolly McBride JacobsonnaturedudeLLynnsshaw95FFacebook567422532,2010-03-27 00:00:00,"Frost Bank Tower,Toy Joy,Museum of the Weird,Susanna Dickinson Museum","1950s All-Electric House,Marconi National Historic Site,Silverball Museum Arcade,Tesla's Wardenclyffe Laboratory",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/austin-moonlight-towers

Dorset played host to a huge mining boom in the late 1700s due to the high quality and uniquely colored marble that sat in the bedrock of the mountains surrounding the town.From the year 1785, when the first marble quarry broke ground, up until the 1920s, marble from the Dorset quarries found its place in the architecture of cities like New York and Washington, D.C. It wasn’t until the invention of the cheaper and more versatile Portland cement that the demand for the marble dropped and forced many of the quarries to largely go bust. Unlike other quarries in the area that were primarily just large holes dug into the Earth, the Freedly Quarry is unique in that it’s a deep, arch-shaped cavern dug directly into the east slope of Mount Aeolus. The cave features many offshoot passageways and a large pond of water that freezes solid in the wintertime, making it a perfect unique spot for ice skating.During the summer months, off-road vehicles can be found making the trek into the cave, making use of the old jeep trails that snake their way through the Green Mountain forests to get to the entrance. ",This cavernous abandoned marble mine is popular with ice skaters in the winter. ,"Danby Quarry,Grave of Mr. Barbo,Depot 62","3817-5015 Dorset Hill Rd Dorset, Vermont United States",43.2873,-73.0168,andrewvolentfradeykat81erjeffery,2018-01-31 00:00:00,"Danby Quarry,Depot 62,Grave of Mr. Barbo,The Pember Museum","Ice Cave of Bixby State Preserve,Crystal Ice Cave,Rock Quarry Cave,Ellenville Fault Ice Caves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/freedlyville-quarry

Town residents walk their dogs next to colonnaded red brick buildings and jog through the hundreds of acres of surrounding forest and pastures.But buried beneath the grounds there is a system of deep tunnels, leading not to lecture halls or the student union, but to confinement rooms, psychosurgery laboratories, operating rooms, and even a morgue.For most of the 20th century, the tunnels were used to shuttle psychiatric patients between their treatments, in what grew to be Fairfield State Hospital, also known as Fairfield Hills, one of the largest psychiatric institutions in New England.The state-run hospital treated patients from the early 1930s until it was shut down in 1995. Over the decades, the facility expanded from 500 beds in the early years, to over four thousand at its peak. And although it was built as a way of easing the overcrowding of two other Connecticut facilities, the ratio of the medical staff to patient was always a challenge, averaging 200 to one for doctors, and 80 to one for nurses.Since the last residents were moved to other facilities in 1995, the campus has sat mostly vacant, its buildings slowly crumbling and tunnels sealed off. Its fate rests in the hands of the town of Newtown, which acquired the entire parcel from the state in 2004, and there have been various redevelopment plans that have come in fits and starts.

767,The Recumbent Effigy of Victor Noir,"catacombs and crypts,cemeteries,statues",622,1037,"European funeral art has given many artists the opportunity to explore their own style by experimenting with the idea of an everlasting memorial. What image should remain as an eternal monument linking the absence of a human being and the sorrow of their family?In his photographic journey “Erotique du Cimetiere”, contemporary artist and funeral art specialist Andre Chabot offers a wonderful reflection on how voluptuous female nude statues became the ultimate symbol of mourning, appeasing our wounded souls through the sensuality of their curves. But if femininity is a common motif in French cemeteries, the grave of Victor Noir and the incongruous folklore that surounds its effigy offers new possibilities in the Eros equation.Victor Noir, a 19th-century political journalist, is one of those people who will be better remembered in death than in life. Shot in a duel by Prince Pierre Bonaparte in 1870, he became a symbol of the imperial injustice and a martyr for the Republic. More than one hundred thousand people came to his funeral, where frenetic weeping was mixed with calls for insurrection. After the downfall of the Second Empire, Victor Noir’s remains were transferred to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery, and a bronze effigy was commissioned to the sculptor Jules Dalou in praise of his memory.Noir was depicted as an elegant man, lying dead on the floor after the impact of the lethal bullet, his top hat tipped over on his side. Dalou chose to represent Noir in a very realistic way, his face having the detailed quality of a cast death mask. However, another detail of Noir’s anatomy would soon get more attention than the sober realism of the memorial bronze. The dead Victor, in his eternal sleep, bears an under-belt bump that a lot of his living fellows would be jealous of.Victor Noir is nowadays one of the most visited residents in the graveyard, right after Jim Morrison and Allan Kardec. His popularity is not because of his talent as a journalist, nor his symbolic role, but lies in the notorious lump in his pants. A generation of superstitious (or just randy) women have decided that taking indecent rubbings of Victor’s impressive girth could prevent infertility, and perform these rubbings in more than the traditional manner.After a century of daily joyrides (even burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese had a go) Victor Noir’s lips and groin are shiny and nickel-clean, while the rest of his body presents the greenish tone of oxidized bronze. In 2004, when a fence was erected around Victor Noir’s tomb to deter fertility-seekers from carnally touching the statue, women were so offended that a few noisy protests were staged in the cemetery, enough to have the fence torn down.",Victor Noir's effigy gets more action than the man himself ever did. ,"Père Lachaise Cemetery,Georges Méliès's Grave,Grave of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier","16 rue du repos Cimetière du Père Lachaise - Division 92 Paris, 75020",48.8614,2.3933,reley250mordekiaphiloursmarsMartin,2013-01-28 00:00:00,"Grave of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier,Père Lachaise Cemetery,Georges Méliès's Grave,Lines of Cremains at Père Lachaise Cemetery","The Haserot Angel,Jules Verne's Tomb,Eternal Silence,Meriwether Lewis Monument",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erotic-erosion-recumbent-effigy-victor-noir

Its members, known as “Els savis del Born” (“The Wise Born”) enjoyed exquisite meetings around the palace’s cabinet of curiosities and musical instruments. Today, the historic Palau de Dalmases operates as a flamenco performance venue, but has retained some of its original treasures, such as the Baroque courtyard and the salomic columns on the staircase, on which you’ll find a frieze depicting the mythological story of Neptune’s chariot.

Due to Venice’s constant flooding, however, these picturesque piles are all placed inside bathtubs, waterproof bins, and in one room a full-size gondola.The name itself even means “Book Store of High Water.” When the local waterways rise to fill the store, the water can rise inches off the floor, which would destroy any other collection. The store’s whimsically cramped atmosphere is even reflected in their “fire escape,” which is simply a door leading directly out into a canal. To really complete the look, the store has become home to more than one stray cat, who are also able to escape the rising tides by hanging out atop the stacks.   ",This Venice bookstore has resigned itself to constant flooding by keeping its books in bathtubs and boats. ,"Reliquaries of St Mark's Basilica Treasury,The Flooded Crypt of San Zaccaria,Scuola Grande di San Marco",5173 Calle Lunga 5176/B Venice,45.438,12.3423,zackofalltradesspadaadjustingcourtneymayExpatncagreggc80elaine3355JJulius Spadaggreggc80sspadaadjustingLuka Esenkobbriannafowlereelaine3355Expatncareley250plananccourtneymaytylercolesshaw95,2013-02-13 00:00:00,"Scuola Grande di San Marco,The Flooded Crypt of San Zaccaria,Reliquaries of St Mark's Basilica Treasury,Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs","White Rabbit Books & Curiosities,Booked Up,Le Roy Lire,Faulkner House Books",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/libreria-acqua-alta

A modern excavation done in the 1990s revealed that the area was heaped with bodies, some basically piled in mass graves. Even more grisly, the excavation led to the discovery that more than 40 percent of the graves were fetuses, or infants under the age of one. Researchers also discovered that bodies in the cemetery had come into contact with a number of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, and Paget’s disease.Today, the horrors of the cemetery are recognized and remembered each Halloween and the site now houses an unofficial memorial garden, although most of it remains under concrete. The red fence outside it is densely decorated with tributes in the form of flowers and ribbons and the names of those buried and left to be forgotten. ","This South London cemetery holds the remains of more than 15,000 people. ","The Clink Prison Museum,Memorial to Mahomet Weyonomon,Old Operating Theatre Museum & Herb Garret","21 Redcross Way London, England, SE1 1SD United Kingdom",51.5037,-0.0936,serflacStevrentealeavesAnnetta BlackatimianlostlaratthedyerghoulhouseSStevrenttealeaveslostlaraSEANETTAatimianAnnetta Black,2012-01-11 00:00:00,"Old Operating Theatre Museum & Herb Garret,The Clink Prison Museum,Memorial to Mahomet Weyonomon,Gordon Museum of Pathology","Most Holy Trinity Cemetery,Jules Verne's Tomb,Old Burial Ground,Hunter S.

Some of the specimens were even collected by Charles Darwin himself, a statue of whom sits in the main hall near a replica of a Diplodocus donated by Andrew Carnegie. The building was constructed with terracotta tiles in order to resist the soot in the air of Victorian London, with the west wing and the east wing are adorned with images of living and extinct species, respectively. However, you may note a coelacanth in the extinct animals wing, as it was of course only recently that ancient fish was revealed to still be living on our planet. In 2015 it was controversially announced that the popular diplodocus skeleton in the main hall (it can be seen in one of the photos) would be removed on the grounds that it was not a genuine skeleton. This resulted in a well supported “save Dippy” campaign, but the decision stands to give pride of place to the real skeleton of a blue whale. As such, in 2017, a blue whale skeleton was hung from the ceiling.

Instead, the Titanic survivors arrived in New York on the Carpathia, a Cunard Line ship. After a brief stop at Pier 59 to drop off the lifeboats from Titanic, the Carpathia traveled a few blocks south to dock at the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Anxious crowds of people, numbering in the thousands, awaited the arrival of the Carpathia and news of loved ones.The same pier also played a pivotal role in another ill fated ship disaster.  Just three years later, in 1915, the ship Lusitania left from Pier 54 before being torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Ireland on May 7. The Lusitania sank in less than 20 minutes, killing almost all of the 2,000 passengers and crew.Now part of Hudson River Park, a number of plans to restore the pier have been bandied about, but none so far have been successful. Instead, it remains a blank, empty strip of metal and concrete stretching out into the Hudson River, remarkable mostly for its emptiness. The only obvious hint of its historical significance is the rusted arch that used to form the entrance, with the original shipyard lettering barely readable – “Cunard White Star” – left untouched and eroding out of either respect or neglect, probably both.Since then, fascination with the tragedy of the Titanic has only grown, but interest in Pier 54 and its spectral place in history has fallen by the wayside.Update April 2018: The pier has been closed due to construction but the old gate is still visible.Update May 2021: The gate now frames the South Bridge entrance to Little Island, a two-acre public open space built on a platform over the Hudson River.",A dilapidated dock tells the story of Titanic's missed arrival. ,"The Jane Hotel,The Remnants of Manhattan's Thirteenth Avenue,The High Line","Pier 54 West Street and 13th Street New York, New York, 10014",40.7414,-74.0099,Mark CaseyMolly McBride Jacobsonerjefferyronangobruenaorue1 44b5cec1LLiamYMMtnLadyaaorue1 44b5cec1CCallMeCooperaaspearAnna MinsteresotericrootsgobruenwwhiteysafcerjefferyMolly McBride Jacobsoniirregularhexronansspecs1624Rachel,2012-04-15 00:00:00,"The High Line,The Remnants of Manhattan's Thirteenth Avenue,The Jane Hotel,Life Underground Sculptures","Valerian Wall at Niche Hotel,Klafthmonos Square Parking Structure Fortification Walls,Ex-Monastery of Santiago Apóstol,Portada de la Antigua Iglesia de San Isidoro (Arch of the Old Church of San Isidoro)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pier-54-titanics-destination
775,Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,"relics,catacombs and crypts,churches,sacred spaces",966,2569,"The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is a 58,000-square-foot complex designed by Spanish architect, Rafael Moneo. Also known as the Los Angeles Cathedral, the building opened in 2002 in order to replace the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, which was severely damaged during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Both buildings stand as a monument to Saint Vibiana, a third century Roman martyr and patron saint of Los Angeles.The cathedral was designed in an unusual postmodern architectural style and features a minimal display of right angles, appearing more like an imposing fortress than a welcoming place of worship. Cardinal Roger Mahoney, the cathedral’s archbishop, received much criticism for wanting to build a cathedral in such an appearance and scale. Many critics believed that plans for the church were over-elaborate, such as the $3M it cost for the large bronze doors which, instead of displaying biblical scenes, featured symbolic imagery corresponding to Christian mystical numbers.Nevertheless, Cardinal Mahoney had grand visions for the cathedral. With the themes of “Light” and “Journey” in mind, architect Moneo incorporated large windows made of Spanish alabaster into the interior. As such, the cathedral is said to feature the largest use of alabaster in the United States. Cardinal Mahoney also budgeted $5M for a Rosso Laguna marble table, $1M for the cathedra, and $2M for the wooden ambo. If that weren’t enough, the cathedral itself was also purposely built to be 333 feet long, just one foot longer than St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York.The lower level of the building is no less elaborate. A light-filled and modern mausoleum featuring 6,000 crypts sits in the cathedral’s basement. A number of prior bishops and archbishops have been buried there, and Academy Award winner Gregory Peck is also interred in this sumptuous crypt. Today, vaults are available to members of the church. The mausoleum features stained glass windows from the original cathedral and Judson Studios, one of the oldest liturgical studios in North America.Of the entombed, the most notable is perhaps Saint Vibiana, whose relics were discovered in Roman catacombs in 1853. Aside from deducing that she had lived during the third century, not much else is known about the life of young Vibiana. Her body was laid to rest with nothing but a vial of blood, a laurel wreath, and a tablet that read: “to the soul of the innocent and pure Vibiana.” In 1854, Vibiana was designated the title of “virgin martyr” and an annual memorial feast was granted in her honor.","Crypt mausoleum in cathedral's basement contains relics of third century Roman martyr, Saint Vibiana. ","Triforium,Bradbury Building,'América Tropical'","555 West Temple Street Los Angeles, California, 90012 United States",34.0577,-118.2449,anhieJaszmina SzendreyAvoiding RegretjDreamsJames RicciPrestonWjjDreamsFred CherrygardenJames Riccibenjaminharmon1wwumanchildLLaserGirlnnooker21PPrestonWAvoiding RegretJaszmina Szendrey,2009-10-25 00:00:00,"Triforium,'América Tropical',Bradbury Building,Angels Flight","San Thome Basilica,Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte,The Relic Crypt of St. Helena at Église Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles,The Skeletons of Waldsassen Basilica",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cathedral-our-lady-angels

The result is a luscious bird sanctuary.Bok Tower Gardens was Edward Bok’s gift to the American people. The property encompasses Iron Mountain, one of the highest points in Florida.

It was given that title in 1883 by the wife of an assistant park superintendent after the Latin word for the morning glory flower, which the pool’s blue color resembles. Recently, however, the pool has started to go by another name: “Fading Glory.”The delicate blue water is created by thermophilic bacteria, which thrive in the pool’s searing heat. For over a century, the Morning Glory Pool–a hotspot in Yellowstone National Park–has suffered from inconsiderate visitors who have thrown coins, bottles, and trash into its waters. The trash has slowly built up and blocked some of the thermal vents and reduced the heat of the pool, allowing other bacteria to begin working their way in at the edges, creating a red and yellow ring around the pure blue center. While this rainbow hue is indeed beautiful, it is a fragile beauty, as the invasive yellow bacteria continues to close in.Occasionally, often following seismic activity, the pool erupts in a geyser.

779,The Mail Rail,"secrets,postal,railroads,trains,hidden,subterranean sites",520,2554,"The Post Office Railway—commonly known as “Mail Rail”—was an automatic electric railway created to speed Royal Mail delivery in London by bypassing the city’s congested streets. In the 2000s, Royal Mail deep-sixed the system and the site became a lure for adventurers eager to survey its ruins.Early in the the 20th century, Royal Mail officials sought a way to make delivery faster. They found inspiration in Chicago’s subterranean freight train system. In 1927, after more than a decade of planning and work, the Post Office Railway opened for business. At its height, the system conveyed four million pieces of mail down a 6.5 mile underground stretch of track at speeds approaching 40 miles per hour with termini at Paddington and Whitechapel.Its stations are closer to the surface than the tunnels, which were dug at a depth of 70 feet below the surface. This allowed workers to easily bring mail to the surface and the incline allowed for gravity-powered propulsion and braking. Around the middle of the 20th century, the system reached its peak volume, shuttling 4 million pieces of mail a day. As the century wore on, however, the mail volume dwindled, and the railroad went into the red.In 2003, the railroad was closed down and abandoned and many of the entry points were sealed off.  It was long thought inaccessible, but after a group of partiers forced their way into the system others sought to find access. Since then, a few intrepid explorers, cameras in hand, have made the voyage underground. Gaining entry through mail sorting offices, explorers trekked through the tunnels and the ghost stations while trying to avoid detection by security cameras.Their images reveal an empty but intact world. Much of the rail equipment appears in working order, sitting dormant, waiting to deliver one last love letter. Since the end of July 2017, the site has now been turned into the Postal Museum complete with a 20-minute ride on specially made miniature trains (which will start operating from 4th September 2017).",Hidden beneath the streets of London is a secret subway that only carried mail.  ,"The Deadhouse,Carting Lane Sewer Lamp,London Transport Museum","Royal Mail Paddington Sorting Office 128-142 Praed Street Paddington London, England, WC2R 0HS",51.5112,-0.1198,Gerard NolanSnowdrop68edintucsonBartekSoltysMartinreley250Snowdrop68eedintucsonjjxf3reley250BartekSoltysMolly McBride JacobsonMMartin,2013-06-13 00:00:00,"London Transport Museum,Carting Lane Sewer Lamp,The Deadhouse,10 Adam Street","Box Tunnel Entrance,Rifle Sight Notch,Bramhope Tunnel North Portal,Beechview-Seldom Seen Greenway",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mail-rail-london-england

Once a movie house specializing in showing classic films, and now a lovely, well appointed neighborhood theatre, the building had a storied history he had barely discovered.Renovating the theatre in 1964 Otway found a bunker-like maze of tunnels in the basement, including two safes. He called in a safe cracker to find $2,000,000 in gold certificates, unfortunately expired. As it turned out his theatre was once a thriving clandestine speakeasy ran by the previous owner and gangster, Walter Sheib.In its day, entrance to the secret club was gained from the butcher shop around the corner on 1st Avenue. There was once an elevated railroad with a station right at the corner of 1st and St. Marks, and with all the crowds of passengers, those in search of an illegal cocktail could slip into the butchers shop unseen. At the back of the shop was a tunnel which led between the buildings and into the backstage of the dancehall. The butcher shop is now an Afghan restaurant, but the building’s windows still sag from the lack of foundations, caused by the tunnels.Today the theatre is owned by Otway’s son Lorcan. As well as the theatre, he has converted two rooms upstairs into a lovely little museum dedicated to the gangsters who owned and operated the speakeasy and many others like it across the country. On display are one of the cracked safes, bullets recovered from the St. Valentine’s Day massacre, moonshine stills, and medicinal prohibition whiskey. Entrance to the museum comes with a tour through the theatre and down into the basement tunnels as well. Down in the basement there are still the original telephones that ran between the speakeasy and the warehouse where the illegal booze was stored. Also on display is a complex series of wires, showing where Walter Scheib had rigged up the building with explosives, so in the event of a raid, he could detonate all the evidence!The theatre also includes a bar, The William Barnacle Tavern, where intrepid Gangster enthusiasts can begin and end their tour with one of the most complete ranges of absinthe available in the city.It’s estimated that in the height of prohibition there were over 30,000 speakeasies in the city, and this is one of the authentic ones still left.

Throughout his distinguished booze-slinging career, Ray claimed to have served hundreds of celebrities including Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Bette Davis, John Wayne, Clark Gable, and Howard Hughes.One of the more intriguing legendary stories about Ray involves the movie Mutiny on the Bounty.  MGM had decided to shoot the movie on an isolated area of Catalina Island. The desolate location didn’t have much for the cast and crew to do after work hours, so Clark Gable bankrolled a bar on set and called it “Christian’s Hut” after his character in the movie. After the shoot, the bar remained, and Ray became the barkeep. Easier to reach by sea than land, the Tahitian-style watering hole was used almost exclusively by yachtsmen and celebrities in the know.In 1960, Ray’s father-in-law decided he was going to sell his small violin shop on Sunset Blvd. When Ray expressed interest in purchasing it to establish his very own bartending school, his wife and her father balked. The father-in-law told him he would only sell it to him if he opened his own bar instead of a school.Eventually Ray brought his son, Mike into the business and they bartended together, Ray passing on boozy family secrets.

784,The Sherlock Holmes Museum,"bars,literature,shops",1236,2524,"The Sherlock Holmes pub on Northumberland Avenue, near London’s Charing Cross Station, is much like the countless other pubs in the capital. That is until you venture upstairs where, in the dining room, is a life-size copy of the apartment shared by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Until 1957, the Sherlock Holmes Pub was known as the Northumberland Arms. But then, its owners had the fortune of acquiring an entire exhibit dedicated to the world’s most famous detective that had been created for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Curated by the Westminster Library and sponsored by the Abbey National building society, the Holmes exhibit was as detailed as it was authentic. After the Festival closed, the whole Holmes collection was installed in the pub, which was renamed in honor of its new fictional tenants on the upper floor. The recreated study of 221b Baker Street is, according to the pub, “as it appeared on a crisp day in the years following the great detective’s return to London in 1894.”The rooms are decorated with the famous pipe, violin, and scientific equipment, while the wall is marked with a VR (for Victoria Regina) made by Holmes’ pistol shots. Plaster casts of some great bloodhound prepared by New Scotland Yard lie next to a snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the center, a gift from the King of Bohemia in connection with the Irene Adler papers.The attention to detail is remarkable, and the many screen and stage depictions of Holmes and Watson are represented with props and artwork. So lifelike is the representation of 221b Baker Street, that it feels like you’ve stepped back into Conan Doyle’s Victorian London.",This London pub hides a peculiar secret: a recreation of the rooms shared at 221b Baker Street by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. ,"British Optical Association Museum,Charing Cross Mural,London's Lilliputian Police Station","10 Northumberland Street London, England, WC2N 5DB United Kingdom",51.5073,-0.1253,Luke J SpencerMartinCollector of ExperienceshrnickSnowdrop68nickylouderSnowdrop68marks6nnickylouderCollector of ExperiencesSEANETTAhrnickMMartin,2016-02-11 00:00:00,"British Optical Association Museum,Charing Cross Mural,London's Lilliputian Police Station,Charing Cross Storm Tree","White Rabbit Books & Curiosities,The Perch Inn,The Llandoger Trow,Alice's Shop",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-sherlock-holmes-pub-london-england

Huge hoodoos (tall, thin rock spires) and small labyrinths of odd stone shapes have been created by eons of water and moisture wearing away at a softer layer of ash, creating improbable, top-heavy oddities.

One of the buildings is shaped like a flying saucer, and the other three are as if spheres were joined together, looking like huge concrete caterpillars.Talk from the locals about the domes concerns ritualistic witchcraft and satanic worship. “Stay out of there and don’t go into the tunnels” is the refrain, and indeed there are tunnels under the eastern end of this facility. But despite all the stories, whether anything more sinister than underage beer-drinking, ghost stories, and the occasional squatter spending the night has ever happened is unknown.Nonetheless, staying out of the tunnels is probably good advice.Update January 2018: One dome has collapsed, and the city has ordered the destruction of the domes.

During the 13th-century Alexander II built the first incarnation of Eilean Donan to defend the surrounding mountains of Kintail and the Isle of Skye against the Viking hordes. This original castle is said to have an immense curtained wall connecting seven towers and spanning the entire island. Come 1719, a lesser-known Jacobite uprising partially destroyed the structure, and for the following 200 years, it lay in near ruins. Finally, in 1911, Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap arrived. He bought the island and restored the castle, reopening it in 1932.Jutting artfully from its island perch at the intersection of three lochs, the castle has been featured in a number of ad campaigns, television, and films, such as; The New Avengers (1976), Highlander (1986), and Entrapment (1999). As of 2021, the Internet Movie Database (IMBD lists 21 entries in which it was used as a location, beginning with “Bonnie Prince Charlie” starring David Niven in 1948.

789,Medici Hall of Maps (Sala delle Carte Geografiche) ,"dead explorers,marvelous maps and measures,geography,repositories of knowledge,maps,history",599,1040,"When Giorgio Vasari undertook the restoration of the grand old Palazzo della Signoria, now known as the Palazzo Vecchio, he envisioned a new room adorned with maps of Italy and the known world, portraits of all of the great minds of the era, and illustrations of exotic plants and animals from far off lands.Vasari made plans for two enormous globes - one of the earth, another of the heavens - to lower from the ceiling onto bases so perfectly designed, the lightest touch would send them spinning. The room he made these elaborate plans for was not the entry hall, or the offices, or the grand assembly room. It was instead the Guardaroba Nuevo, or “new storeroom,” a new addition to the many storage rooms that held the Medici family treasures in order.When Cosimo I de’ Medici, the Duke of Florence, was elected at the young age of 17, he was an unknown upstart. Raised largely in the countryside without the elaborate urban education and training his predecessors had enjoyed, the new duke turned to Vasari to help him establish his legacy.In the end, Cosimo I “the Great” became one of history’s great art patrons, giving Florence the Uffizi, the Vasari Corridor over the Ponte Vecchio, and a re-vitalized Palazzo della Signoria.The Palazzo Vecchio was first built in 1299 as the seat of power in Florence. Cosimo I charged Vasari with retrofitting the palace to meet the needs of the Renaissance empire. In 1563 they employed the gifted Italian priest, mathematician and mapmaker Ignazio Danti to complete the vision of a grand hall of maps.In the room now known as the Sala delle Carte Geografiche (Hall of maps) on the second floor of the Palazzo Vecchio, 54 maps decorate cabinet fronts, alongside 237 portraits of luminaries of the Renaissance. Inspired largely by the illustrated Renaissance edition of Ptolomy’s “Geographica” as well as new innovations in cartography by Mercator  and Orelius, Danti painted the first 31 maps between 1563-1575, followed by another 23 maps created by Stefano Bonsignori, granducal cosmographer to Cosimo I’s son, Francesco I de’ Medici. The Santucci armillary sphere (now at the Florence Museum of the History of Science) once also was displayed Sala delle Carte Geografiche, along with a second, earlier armillary sphere that is now lost.The room is sometimes referred to as the Sala del Mappamundo, after the huge terrestrial globe also created by Danti that now sits in the middle of the room. Although the original vision of it descending from the ceiling never came to pass, it was built on a specially designed base, and it was, in his own words “moved in any direction by the touch of a single finger.” The second celestial globe was never completed. Unfortunately an ill-advised move to the Uffizi in later years left the existing globe subject to the elements, and it is now much darkened and weathered. Perhaps most sad is that with its original base lost, it no longer moves with the smooth motion that made Danti so proud.Years after his work in Florence, Danti was called to Rome where he created the Vatican’s vast Gallery of Maps the last of his great cartographical works.",Over 50 exquisite hand-painted Renaissance maps decorate a Medici storage room.  ,"Studiolo Francesco I de’ Medici,Il Porcellino ,L’importuno di Michelangelo","Palazzo Vecchio Piazza della Signoria  Florence, 50122",43.7694,11.256,Annetta Blackcontenderspf50merarirubalcavafvcobain,2010-06-28 00:00:00,"Studiolo Francesco I de’ Medici,L’importuno di Michelangelo,Il Porcellino ,Galileo's Middle Finger","Geodetic Center of North America,Washington Mini Monument,Gallery of Maps - Galleria delle Carte Geografiche,Mercator Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sala-delle-carte-geografiche-hall-of-maps

The majority of his work took the form of over-sized steel abstractions that would shift and move in the wind. From fantastical birds to undulating spires, Kempf’s work was generally seen as joyous. However, like many artists before him, Kempf harbored a dark streak, which for him manifested in some of his lesser known sculptural works which he generally kept private. This darkness would finally overtake him in 1995 when he took his own life.After Kempf passed away, a number of his works remained where he had positioned them in his front yard. Fans and sightseers began flocking to the home to see his works and the artist’s daughter began giving tours of the site as well. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with some of the other wards of the artist’s estate, not to mention Kempf’s neighbors. The city, backed by one of Kempf’s relatives, came to the home to remove some of the works, but Kempf’s daughter fiercely protested the action.

Groups of 10 or more can also just rent the whole place and play hide and seek.The tour starts out with Jim’s lecture/rant on the history of the building and key events in his life, delivered in a manic, partly in-character patter calibrated to weird everyone out without actually scaring anyone. Tour participants then follow Jim through the house, outside into his haunted sculpture garden, back in through a labyrinth of secret passages and dioramas, up stairs, down slides, into the ancient wine cellar which apparently used to be a speakeasy bar, back up via yet another secret passage and finally out into the real world. Tours can last anywhere from 1-3 hours and Jim keeps up his running commentary throughout, in addition to playing pranks. If you remember the ’70s 3-D board game “Haunted House” (a.k.a. “Which Witch”), touring the Raven’s Grin Inn is very much like walking (and climbing, and occasionally crawling) through that game.

The market has been in operation since 1805, making it the oldest continuously operating open-air fish market in the United States. (The distinction of second-oldest belongs to the Fulton Fish Market in New York City, which opened 17 years later.)  The majority of the seafood sellers here have been shilling shellfish along the waterfront for decades, if not for generations. In the early days, the seafood at the Maine Avenue Fish Market was served directly from fishing boats alongside the pier. More recently, the goods are trucked in and visitors are attended to from docked barges.Over the years, the wares on display have expanded to suit Washingtonians’ ever-more cosmopolitan tastes. Local favorites are now displayed alongside Chinese octopus and Chilean sea bass. If it comes from the sea, it’s likely available at one of the brightly colored stands lining the dock. However, most visitors are still lining up for Chesapeake Bay classics: blue crabs, oysters, and shrimp.The Maine Avenue Fish Market is famously full-service. Most vendors will cook the seafood to order, tossing customers’ favored crabs into massive vats of boiling water. You can also elect to have your seafood seasoned.

This tragic accident, and the lives and legacies of the performers who perished in it, are immortalized by a couple of unique monuments at the site where it occurred.It was February 3, 1959 that the small Beechcraft Bonanza carrying the musicians crashed in a farmer’s field in Clear Lake, Iowa. Holly and the others had been on a taxing road tour, that gave Holly the flu and some of the other bandmates frostbite from the freezing cold bus rides. Having had enough, Holly chartered the small plane, which was ill-equipped for that night’s severe, wintry weather. Moments after takeoff, the pilot lost control of the aircraft. Within seconds, it smashed into the ground, killing all four souls aboard.The performers’ remains were buried in their respective home states, but the crash site— remote as it is—has evaded obscurity.  In 1988, a guitar-shaped memorial marked where the plane went down, still a private cornfield. Later on, another permanent monument to the crash was put up just off the highway. This memorial is a bit simpler, just a giant pair of Buddy Holly’s iconic glasses, sitting on pillars.Even today, people pay their respects to the memorials, leaving little tokens to their dearly departed musical idols. The glasses can be found on the roadside, but the actual crash site is set back from the road, and can be harder to find. However, visitors have reported that the locals, including the farmer on whose property the memorial resides, are more than happy to help.      ",A giant pair of thick black glasses mark the tragic demise of a trio of rock and roll legends. ,"Spam Museum,National Hobo Convention,The Hobo Museum","22728 Gull Ave Clear Lake, Iowa, 50428 United States",43.2238,-93.3751,EricGrundhausertomcorbett1Rhapsodic BohemianDarrell PowersdianekendallMartinffehrmarydianekendallDarrell Powersttomcorbett1Rhapsodic Bohemianllilpunk1MMartin,2015-10-21 00:00:00,"The Hobo Museum,National Hobo Convention,Spam Museum,Jolly Green Giant Statue","Michael Jackson Denkmal (Michael Jackson Memorial),Lynyrd Skynyrd Monument,Mausoleum of José Alfredo Jiménez,Frank Zappa Memorial",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-day-the-music-died-memorial-clear-lake-iowa

Once covered by a lake, the water evaporated some 2,000 years ago, leaving behind a 1,000 foot-layer of salt and minerals. Part of an extensive salt pan, the Devil’s Golf Course was created over many years as water occasionally rises up through the salt bed and reshapes the formations. When the water evaporates in the blazing heat, the large infernal stalagmites and spiky mounds are what get left behind. The ground is so full of pointy salt spikes–some as tall as two feet high–that it can be difficult to walk, much less play golf.This of course is the joke, and an old one at that. A 1934 National Park Service guidebook to Death Valley said, “only the devil could play golf” on this surface, and the name stuck.

They combine a bold functionalist style with more traditional Mexican forms and touches, including the colors and rows of cacti (O’Gorman is considered the father of Mexican functionalism).The left house belonged to Diego. In his studio, it’s possible to see the painter’s “judas” collection, a collection of papier-mâché cartonería figures of humans, skeletons, and animals, all assembled in the studio where he first constructed them.

799,Seljavallalaug,"swimming pools,pools,hidden",321,898,"Going for a swim is probably not the first thing visitors to Iceland think to do, but seeing the lovely, historic Seljavallalaug pool might change their minds. Built in 1923, Seljavallalaug may be the oldest swimming pool in the entire country. It was created as a place where locals could learn to swim. Though many of them subsisted off the fishing industry, there was no formal place for them to develop their swimming skills. In modern Iceland, swimming training is mandatory in public schools, a trend that began with facilities such as Seljavallalaug.The 82-foot-long pool is built right into the rocks, in a shallow valley created by a pair of verdant, craggy hills. Until 1936, the remote swimming hole was the largest pool in Iceland. It is fed by a nearby hot spring that usually keeps the water at a temperature above freezing, although in the winter, ice still forms on the surface. On the far end of the pool is a small changing room that provides some privacy. It is basic–don’t expect showers–but does the job for those of a more modest nature.Getting to the pool is an adventure in  itself. Visitors can drive fairly close to the secluded valley that holds the Seljavallalaug, but they must eventually park and set out on foot. The trek to the pool takes around 20 minutes of hiking through fields of lava ash, dodging little streams running out of the valley.Seljavallalaug is not maintained in any official capacity but is cleaned once a year by a team of local volunteers. The waters are often covered in algae, and after the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, ash. Yet no matter what is floating in the historic waters of the pool, its natural beauty makes even ash and algae easy to ignore.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

While the parsonage was built in 1681 (and first housed one George Burroughs, an unfortunate cleric who was later himself accused of witchcraft and hanged), it was torn down by the late 18th century in a state of near-collapse.

However by late in the 13th century, the repeated fires had sent a message to the local builders and it was replaced with a stone bridge ended by large stone churches at either terminus of the span. By the 15th century the vaulted bridge was one of the only constructions to survive another fire, this time one that destroyed much of the surrounding city of Erfurt. After this, the current buildings were built atop either side of the narrow bridge. All told, 62 narrow houses were built atop the bridge, each carrying about three storeys.The constructions have survived to the present day, although the houses have been converted to around 32 living and commercial spaces. The ground level storefronts are mainly antique and artisan shops while the upper levels of the building are still private residences. The bridge homes are the jewel of the city which celebrates their claim to fame each year with a festival centered on the little community called Krämerbrückenfest.  ",This historic stone bridge has an entire neighborhood clinging to its sides. ,"The Living Fence,Kika Figures of Erfurt,Auerworld Palace","Krämerbrücke Erfurt, 99084 Germany",50.9787,11.0312,EricGrundhauserBalkanTurist,2014-09-08 00:00:00,"Kika Figures of Erfurt,The Living Fence,Auerworld Palace,East German Bunker Museum","Castello di Amorosa,Margalef,Historic Melnik,Tasmania's 'Town of Murals'",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kramerbrucke

His experiences would lead to the drafting of the bill that created the Interstate Highway System. Much of the Lincoln Highway has been renamed to US Route 30 and realigned in various places.In Bedford, David Berton Koontz built the Coffee Pot next to his service station in 1927 to attract customers. It was made of bricks and covered in sheet metal, and was 18 feet tall and 22 feet wide. The Pot changed hands at various points, becoming a diner, bus station, and a bar. In the 1980s, the Pot closed, and languished in disrepair.The Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor bought the pot in 2003 and, with the help of a state grant, moved it from its old location to the Bedford County Fairgrounds and restored it.

803,Devil's Hole,"cults,lost tribes,earthquakes,national parks,subterranean sites,water",189,897,"The Amargosa desert in Nevada is located just over the Funeral Mountains from Death Valley—an area famous for being one of the hottest and driest locations in the Western Hemisphere. This makes it difficult to believe that directly below its surface lies a system of sprawling water-filled caves which are home to many species of ancient and evolving fish.  One gateway into the flooded caverns is a highly protected fissure called Devil’s Hole.Devil’s Hole is a detached unit of Death Valley National Park within the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge to protect the endangered pupfish that are found exclusively in its waters. Scientists estimate that these fish have lived under the desert in isolation for upwards of 25,000 years. The vast size and depth of this geothermal water system have never been fully reached or recorded, though a few have died while exploring the caves.In 1965, 20-year-old Paul Giancontieri and 19-year-old David Rose went “skindiving” in Devil’s Hole. Equipped with only snorkel masks and flippers the two teenagers dove into the hole which is said to extend to a depth of over 900 feet, and is shaped like an inverted funnel. Despite a rigorous rescue effort (there are pockets of air trapped within the cave where someone could theoretically survive for a time) neither of the men was found.Though it is fenced off completely and the entrance is heavily monitored, it has fascinated several travelers over the years, including the infamous one-time Death Valley resident and convicted cult leader, Charles Manson. When Manson arrived in Death Valley he became obsessed with finding a mysterious hole that would lead his “family” to water and a safe place to live in the desert. He wandered the wastelands for days on end looking for this place—and finally found it at Devil’s Hole. Rumor has it that he spent three days sitting cross-legged, staring, and meditating inside the fenced-in observation point near the 60,000-year-old fissure. He was sure that the waters were just blocking the door to the underground kingdom that would provide shelter and water for his group when it was needed—and all he had to do was find a way to drain it first. Given the huge estimated size of those waters, this would have been quite a feat. Devil’s Hole has one other unique claim to fame—it measures seismic activity throughout the world. Earthquakes as far away as Indonesia have caused the waters to splash over six feet above normal levels. These seismic waves have been likened to mini-underground tsunamis and have continued to happen even when the earth shakes halfway around the planet.For both safety and environmental reasons, it is not possible to approach Devil’s Hole, but it can be seen from an official overlook.",Water of undetermined depth has attracted rare fish and cult leaders alike. ,"Amargosa Opera House,Alien Cathouse and Area 51 Gift Shop,Coffin It Up","Amargosa Valley, Nevada, 89020 United States 36.4252, -116.2909Book a hotel on Kayak Visit Website NearbyAmargosa Opera House10.97 milesCoffin It Up16.86 milesAlien Cathouse and Area 51 Gift Shop18.31 miles",36.4252,-116.2909,zackofalltradesJames RicciRachelWhiskeyBristlesthenoblewomanShannon OhairetthenoblewomanWhiskeyBristlesJames Ricciccarlsontcclaude chappeShannon OhaireRachellittlebrumble,2013-07-07 00:00:00,"Amargosa Opera House,Coffin It Up,Alien Cathouse and Area 51 Gift Shop,Yucca Mountain Repository","Gallery delle Fontane,Lac Souterrain de Saint-Léonard,Qanat di Palermo,Falls Of Dochart",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-hole

The kilns were completed in 1877 and built 25 miles from the mine in a more wooded area. The 25-foot high limestone kilns, constructed from local outcroppings and mortared with lime, gravel, and sand, employed around 40 men in the production and transportation of charcoal bushels to the area near the mine.

But at the intersection of Newbury and Exeter stands a commanding artifact from one of the more fascinating religious movements in American history, the First Spiritual Temple.The ghostly faces carved onto the corners of the building hint at its religious history: This was the first formal house of worship in the United States for Spiritualism. Today the phrase means little to most Americans, but in the middle of the 19th century it was a vibrant religious movement. First made popular by the Fox sisters of Rochester, New York, Spiritualists popularized the idea that the living could commune with the dead through ceremonies like séances.The movement became especially popular during and after the Civil War as families worked with mediums in an attempt to commune with sons, brothers, and fathers who had died during the war (the Ouija board was another manifestation of this movement).Despite its popularity, the movement was mostly one of households and camp revivals, and resulted in few houses of worship. The First Spiritual Temple is a rare, and magnificent, exception. The building, which was completed in 1885, is built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, whose best known example, Trinity Church in Copley Square, is located just a few blocks over. On the corners of the buildings, you can see carvings of ghostly faces, one of the few external clues to the building’s purpose.The building itself only served a religious purpose for two decades.

809,Kyteler's Inn,"celtic,witchcraft,medieval",340,896,"Dame Alice Kyteler was a very powerful woman in 14th century Ireland, but with that power came both devotion and bitter jealousy, the latter leading to the first witch trial in all of Ireland.Born into a wealthy Norman family, Dame Alice continued to amass her fortunes with each of her four marriages. One of her many business ventures was a sprawling stone inn, which was opened sometime around 1323, making it one of the oldest in the entire country. When her last husband fell ill and died, his family feared destitution and began spreading rumors that Dame Alice had used sorcery and poison against him.She was the first woman to be accused of being with an incubus (a demon lover) and was additionally accused of using potions and charms to bewitch and murder, among other ridiculously far-fetched claims. The case was brought to the Bishop of Ossory in 1324, but before he could convict her, the Dame’s wealthy and loyal friends imprisoned him for 16 days in a misguided attempt to dissuade him from persecuting her. His imprisonment only made him more vengeful and she was convicted and sentenced to execution, making her the first witch in Ireland.  Many of her servants and supporters were convicted with her.This was good news for her stepchildren and her enemies, but the night before her execution she was spirited away by those who remained loyal to her. Unfortunately, they could only save her alone, and her longtime faithful servant Petronella spent the next few days being publicly tortured by a very angry bishop. It was the first recorded case of torture used as coercion in a witch trial and he succeeded in getting her to confess to anything and everything he asked. The raging and sadistic bishop then had her burned at the stake, which was also a first, as no one had been executed by fire before. His brutal methods were an instant hit and were implemented in many future witch trials around the world.It is believed that Dame Alice Kyteler fled to England, though no further records of her exist. All that is certain is that she never returned to Kilkenny. The Inn has continued to operate throughout the centuries, sometimes booming and sometimes falling into dereliction and ruin. It has changed hands multiple times, but in 1986 it was sold again to its present owner, who returned the building to its medieval glory but added modern amenities and resumed serving good food, drink and Irish hospitality to locals and tourists alike.

813,Balmy Alley Murals,"street art,activism,alleyways,art outside,graffiti,murals,outsider art",890,897,"In the heart of the Mission District lies the most concentrated collection of murals in San Francisco. Renowned for its political import and reverential maintenance, Balmy Alley has become a destination for appreciators of street art and political culture alike.Springing from an area of the city with a well-founded history of political activism, the murals were first painted in 1972 by Maria Galivez and local children. Artists Patricia Rodriguez and Graciela Carrillo lived in an apartment nearby and soon added their own art to the walls. The work of this two-woman mural team, who referred to themselves as the Mujeres Muralistas, formed the foundation for Balmy Alley’s present-day incarnation, including referencing multiple Latin American countries and cultures within a single, unified visual aesthetic. Their two-woman operation grew into an artist collective made up of Latina women who created a number of murals across the Bay Area.In the mid-1980s, the Balmy Alley murals morphed into a more organized and actively managed purpose. Ray Patlan convened a troupe of mural activists in 1984 to cover all the garage doors and fences running the length of the block with visual meditations on two interconnected themes: praise of indigenous Central American cultural heritage, and protest against the United States’ intervention in Central American affairs.The group of muralists set about convincing (the mainly Latino) property owners of the viability of the idea, seeking permission to paint on pieces of their private property. After a few residents conceded the use of their back fences and gates allowing the community to experience what the finished project would resemble, Balmy Alley quickly gained momentum in the summer of 1985, during which time 27 murals were completed.The experience of engaging with the murals in Balmy Alley is emblematic of their greater political purpose; as each mural seems more powerful for its proximity to the others than it would in isolation, the murals have the effect of mirroring a successful force of community activists.These days Balmy Alley is a constant work in progress, with repairs from weather-related damages taking place at the same time as fresh murals are being painted atop the old. Further diversification of the topics represented in the murals has taken place, making any politicized subject fair game in addition to the original tropes of Latin American human rights.","Since 1973, this block has been home to the most concentrated collection of murals in San Francisco. ","Peephole Cinema,Institute of Illegal Images,Winfield Street Slides ","Balmy Street San Francisco, California, 94110 United States",37.7508,-122.4123,littlebrumbleAnnetta BlackmbisoncgutteryJames Ricci,2009-12-16 00:00:00,"Peephole Cinema,Winfield Street Slides ,Institute of Illegal Images,The Pirate Supply Store at 826 Valencia","Graffiti Alley,Fishbone Alley,Muelle's Graffiti,Aldeia Artística (Artistic Village)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balmy-alley-murals-skb

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as one of the few Kirkbride Buildings to remain in existence in the United States.The Kirkbride Plan was a distinctive design for mental hospitals developed in the mid-1800s by the psychiatrist Thomas Kirkbride. These sprawling, linear buildings were laid out with two wings subdivided into several wards that stretched out from the center to encourage plenty of natural light and good air circulation, as well as segregate patients based on their gender and illness.Like many Kirkbride Buildings, the hospital in Traverse City was threatened with demolition after it closed in 1989, but the city and local residents fought to have the buildings saved from the wrecking ball. Since then, the massive facility has been undergoing renovation and rehabilitation into an impressive mixed-use development of housing, retail, restaurants, and offices known as the Village at Grand Traverse Commons.The complex currently offers tours of the renovation efforts, including a trip through the most impressive aspect of the historic site: the underground tunnel system connecting Building 50 (the Kirkbride structure) with several other buildings. The tunnels are just one part of the historical tour, but they are amazing and impressive, particularly the arching brick main tunnel that the tour route passes through. ",A subterranean world of tunnels links several buildings of this rare 19th-century asylum. ,"Traverse City State Hospital ,Traverse Colantha Walker's Grave,The Hippie Tree","630 Cottageview Dr Traverse City, Michigan United States",44.7568,-85.6437,rickbbikingrbahowell,2019-01-04 00:00:00,"Traverse City State Hospital ,The Hippie Tree,Traverse Colantha Walker's Grave,Botanical Garden Visitor's Center Gift Shop Tunnel","Newhaven Fort,Grave of Philibert Aspairt,Bramhope Tunnel North Portal,Redcliffe Caves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/traverse-city-state-hospital-tunnels

The first shafts were dug in 1867 and active mining in the area continued until 1939. Although trace amounts of gold can still be found in the region, there was never enough gold discovered for the mining operations here to be profitable.Today the abandoned gold mine, left in disrepair, can be found near the historic C&O Canal. The wooden pieces of the structures have mostly been removed and the stonework is mostly fenced off. Most evidence of the gold mining that once took place here has been removed, but behind the National Park Service’s fences you can see the dilapidated remains of an old water tank’s base, the blacksmith shop, and overgrown sealed shaft entrances. Park visitors can hike the Gold Mine Loop trail through the historic Maryland Mine Ruins. ",The ruins of this long-abandoned unsuccessful gold mine can still be found. ,"Patowmack Canal,Naval Surface Warfare Center,Burling Cabin Site","11400-11798 MacArthur Blvd Potomac, Maryland United States",38.9952,-77.2317,WhiskeyBristlesexploringwitheschrelizhAF,2016-08-11 00:00:00,"Patowmack Canal,Naval Surface Warfare Center,Burling Cabin Site,Congressional Country Club","Independence Mine,Delamar Ghost Town,Nevadaville Ghost Town,Custer Ghost Town",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/maryland-gold-mine-ruins
816,Paris Sewer Museum,"sewers,subterranean sites,collections",443,895,"“Paris has another Paris under herself; a Paris of sewers; which has its streets, its crossings, its squares, its blind alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is slime, minus the human form.” —Les Miserables.In 1805, before the advent of the modern sewers, Pierre Bruneseau, an adventurer of sorts, decided to map the ancient and aging sewer system. Although even the police were afraid to enter the sewers, Bruneseau did so, and along the way found lost medieval dungeons, jewels, and the skeleton of an escaped orangutan. Bruneseau finished his survey in 1812.The ancient system was described by his friend Victor Hugo in Les Miserables as “fetid, wild, fierce…” Hugo wrote that “nothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive apparatus of Babylon.” Bruneseau was lauded by Paris as “the most intrepid man in your Empire” and “the Christopher Columbus of the cess-pool.”In 1850, Baron Haussmann and engineer Eugène Belgrand designed the modern Paris sewer system. By 1878, the sewer system was over 373 miles long, and today the network extends 2,100 kilometers beneath the streets of Paris, or farther than the distance from New York to Miami. Hugo said of the new system: “The present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there…”The Parisian sewers are a kind of mirror to the streets above. All are large enough to accommodate a person, and you could rather easily navigate your way around the entirety of Paris via the sewer system. Each sewer “street” has its own blue and white enamel street sign, and each building’s outflow is identified by its real street number.The Parisian sewers have always fascinated tourists, and the sewers were opened to the public during the World Exposition of 1867. Tourists were originally given tours on a small locomotive-drawn wagon, and later, up until the 1970s, in boats. They floated down the wide Parisian sewer canals in a sort of Parisian answer to the gondola. Today, the Parisian sewer system is closed to all but the 800 egoutiers, or sewer workers, with the exception of course of the Les Egouts de Paris, the Sewer Museum of Paris.One of the more intriguing displays in the moderately odorous museum is a giant iron ball. The sewers are regularly cleaned using large wooden or metal spheres just smaller than the system’­s tubular tunnels. The buildup of water pressure behind the balls forces them through the tunnel network until they emerge somewhere downstream, pushing a mass of filthy sludge. And keep an eye out for packages whooshing through the “Pneu” or pneumatic tube system that still runs throughout the Parisian sewer.",The curious underground history of keeping Paris clean. ,"Musée du quai Branly (Quai Branly Museum),Flame of Liberty,Lasco Project at Palais de Tokyo","Pont de l'Alma  Place de la Résistance Paris, 75008",48.8629,2.3017,DylanwythemartofkukufTraveling MavenNikitaDBmsmadnessierryanmitchellmmsmadnessieTraveling MavenNikitaDBmartofkukufwythe,2010-06-15 00:00:00,"Flame of Liberty,Musée du quai Branly (Quai Branly Museum),Lasco Project at Palais de Tokyo,Jules Lavirotte's 29 Avenue Rapp","Stazione Neapolis,Musée des Égouts Bruxelles (Brussels Sewer Museum),Caños del Peral Archaeological Museum,Clean Rivers Tunnel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paris-sewer-museum

It is formed by nine spheres arranged in the the shape that iron atoms take in their delta and alpha allotropes. (In iron’s gamma allotrope, there are extra atoms at the center of each face of the cube.) The Atomium is magnified 165 billion times the normal size of an iron crystal.Designed by André Waterkeyn (the director of a federation of metallurgical companies and not a sculptor by trade), one of the original ideas had been to build an upside down version of the Eiffel Tower, but in keeping with a 1950s atomic age theme, they built the Atomium.The Atomium was recently renovated and all but three of the steel spheres are available to enter and contain everything from an exhibition space, to a restaurant, to a place for Belgian school kids to have sleepovers.Nearby the Atomium is  Mini-Europe, a theme park featuring miniature replicas of European monuments.",Climb inside an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times its normal size. ,"Mini-Europe,Royal Greenhouses of Laeken ,Laeken Cemetery Crypt","Square de l'Atomium Brussels, 1020 Belgium",50.8949,4.3411,DylanphiloursmarsmathewbrowneCollector of ExperiencesLuis MoratoVrielinkiemathewbrownenanpalmeroCollector of ExperiencesLuis MoratolampbaneVrielinkiephiloursmarsMMartinesmetravelsFFacebook100001510821435,2010-05-01 00:00:00,"Mini-Europe,Royal Greenhouses of Laeken ,Laeken Cemetery Crypt,Royal Train Station","La Mona,Epstein's Medical Sculptures,The Dubai Frame ,Rueda Eiffel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-atomium-brussels-belgium

Where do you find rumors of giant catfish that feed on bats? The answer is Nickajack Cave on the Tennessee River. It’s barely three miles from a busy interstate, and you’ve probably never heard of it.Just a short bit upstream from Nickajack Dam is a very large, partly flooded cave rich with history. Currently, you will find it to be a marvelous sight of nature in the late summer as tens of thousands of grey bats leave their perches in the 140-foot-wide cave and head out for dinner. Like a real-life horror movie, you can witness hundreds of them flying overhead, and if you score a kayak or small boat you can sit in the middle of the cove enjoying the most perfect view of it all. As darkness settles around you, bats have consumed all the nearest bugs and begin zooming over the water, passing you by just a few feet. Their trusty echo-location means you need not worry about a collision with them.This cave, with an opening height of 50 feet, was long used by the native people of the area, and later as a saltpeter mine. In the late 1960s, a dam project downstream meant the mouth of the cave would be flooded as well as the remains of old prehistoric villages.There is a fence at the waterline to keep out boaters, but that didn’t deter two divers in 1992. Passing below the fence in search of catfish rumored to feed on any bats not strong enough to hold perch on the roof, they speared a large one but had to return the next day to retrieve it. One of the divers, a man named David Gant, got lost while searching and found himself stranded with his scuba tank running out of air. He survived in an 8-inch air pocket but faced certain death. His dive buddy had made it back to safety and desperately tried to have authorities lower the lake and save Gant. After many hours the sheriff in charge requested TVA open the dam, and Gant was finally saved as the lake level dropped below his 8-inch air pocket. Almost four million gallons of water had been let through the dam lowering the lake by over a foot. As rescuers made it to him he believed they were angels. Rumor has it that long before Gant another man had a spiritual visit deep in Nickajack Cave. In 1967, a desperate Johnny Cash ventured into the cave intending to be lost deep inside by the time the batteries died on his flashlight. After hours in the dark, he became focused on God and from then on said he was “born again” in Nickajack Cave. (Others dispute this story as the dam was completed in December of 1967, implying the opening would have flooded too much to allow deep passage into the cave by that time.) Maybe only God and the Nickajack Cave know the truth",This large cave is a summer home to thousands of bats and has a rich history dating back to prehistoric times.  ,"Raccoon Mountain Caverns,Camak Stone,Cast Iron Cookware Man","Mapleview Rd South Pittsburg, Tennessee United States",34.9925,-85.6128,KenJwayneyp,2019-07-24 00:00:00,"Camak Stone,Cast Iron Cookware Man,Raccoon Mountain Caverns,Rock City","Sudwala Caves,Tham Lod Cave,Beer Quarry Caves,Cave of Dogs",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nickajack-cave
819,Theodore Roosevelt Island,"founding fathers,estates,civil war,mansions,slavery,farms,military history,islands,parks,military,history",1111,896,"The tree-filled national park that Washingtonians today know as Theodore Roosevelt Island would have been unrecognizable to District residents of yesteryear. The island used to be the personal property of descendants of Founding Father George Mason IV, who used the island as a plantation estate worked by enslaved laborers. George Mason III purchased the island around 1717 after the family who previously lived there was murdered by Native Americans and their house was torched. It wasn’t until approximately 1796 that his grandson John Mason began clearing the island, just four years before Congress officially relocated to the nascent federal city. A stately Georgian-style mansion was built on the heights at the southern tip, with views of the White House and Capitol Building construction site. A smattering of buildings were clustered further down the hill, including slave quarters, kitchens, stables, workshops, and an ice house. Today the island is covered with a dense canopy of trees, but in the early 1800s it was a patchwork of carefully laid out cotton and corn fields, with a broad tree-lined avenue running north-south down the middle. John had friends in Washington high society, and he maintained a perpetual open house at the mansion, with its well-stocked wine cellars and stately ballroom. Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe; and Chief Justice John Marshall; are all known to have visited the island. When he wasn’t partying on the island, John Mason was actively involved in several business ventures in Washington. He served as president of local businesses like the struggling Potowmack Canal Company, and in 1815 purchased the nearby Columbia Cannon Foundry, a once nationally famous arms manufacturer.In 1831 the Mason family was abruptly forced to sell their mansion on the Potomac. Numerous histories of Theodore Roosevelt Island attribute this to the nuisance of stagnant water and plagues of mosquitoes. That’s actually fake news—a polite cover story perpetuated by friendly newspaper men of the day. In actuality, Mason’s investments in the city were going belly up, and the island was sold to pay off hounding debt collectors. Thirty years later, during the Civil War, the Union Army occupied the island and used it to billet free African American soldiers attached to U.S. Colored Troops units.In the 1930s, the ruins of the Mason mansion were destroyed and the island was transformed into a national park honoring President Theodore Roosevelt. Two historical plaques are all that remain of the plantation days: one at the site of the house, and one on the northwestern shoreline that repeats the fictional mosquito story.",The national park was once a plantation estate. ,"Washington City Canal Outfall,Abandoned Drawbridge Control Room,Netherlands Carillon","Theodore Roosevelt Island Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.8927,-77.0614,Elliot CarterdmvfillejonespetdavidkovenicatsstaciDenverApplehans,2017-08-30 00:00:00,"Abandoned Drawbridge Control Room,Washington City Canal Outfall,Netherlands Carillon,Watergate Steps","Ben Lomond Historic Site ,Abingdon Plantation Ruins,John Paul Jones Park's Rodman Gun,Bartow-Pell Mansion",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/theodore-roosevelt-island-washington-dc
820,Labyrinth at Audubon Park,"meditation,labyrinths,design,parks",391,893,"In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Labyrinth at Audubon Park was laid as a meditative journey meant to symbolize and facilitate healing for the people of New Orleans.Audubon Park, a 350-acre haven in the Uptown neighborhood, was spared the storm’s flooding despite its location along the banks of the Mississippi. The park is home to some monumental southern live oaks (including the city’s iconic Tree of Life), and a few were blown down during Hurricane Katrina. But the park didn’t suffer the ravages seen by other parts of the city, and its higher ground is now providing a home for New Orleans’ first permanent labyrinth.There are, in fact, two labyrinths, both designed and installed by stone artist Marty Kermeen. Located in the southeast corner of the park, they are connected by a brick path that begins with an entrance through a wrought iron trellis. The first labyrinth is smaller, following an ancient pattern called the Classical Seven Circuit that dates to 2000 B.C.E. Follow the path to the central circle, and you’ve found yourself at a replica of the 13th-century French labyrinth of Chartres Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site.A walk of the labyrinth path is intended as a meditation journey, the design of the red brick walkway making it difficult to grasp what the next turn will be.

Eight tons of nails and 250 gallons of paint were used in constructing the set, and a 250-foot breakwater was built to protect the filming area from the high seas.The film itself was a box-office bomb.

Many who have crossed at night have claimed to have seen the demonic figure of a man with a goat’s head waiting for them at the other side.The bridge got its nickname from a popular local ghost story. The legend concerns a successful African American goat farmer who, in 1938, is said to have been murdered on the bridge at the hands of local members of the Ku Klux Klan. It’s said that the Klansmen lynched the goat farmer, hanging him with a noose over the side of the bridge, but when they went down below to confirm the goat farmer was dead, his body had disappeared.Alternate versions of the ghost story have also circulated, including one that suggests the bridge is actually haunted by the Goatman’s wife. Another story blames the work of Satanists. Most versions of the tale tend to include a warning that knocking three times on the trusses of the bridge runs the risk of bringing out the Goatman. Over the decades there have been numerous alleged sightings of a ghost-like apparition with a goat head haunting the area. Some locals have claimed to see glowing eyes staring at them on the bridge, while others have claimed to hear splashing in the creek directly below, followed by unsettling laughter. In 2017, Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural investigated some of these claims. Naturally, none of the ghost stories surrounding the bridge are based on any specific historical facts.

827,Ape Canyon,"bigfoot,cryptozoology,hoaxes and pseudoscience,nature",161,893,"Ape Canyon is a narrowing gorge sitting just to the southeast of Mount St. Helens where one of the most famous Bigfoot attacks in the cryptozoological canon is said to have taken place in 1924, eventually giving the nature spot its name. According to a story that was widely run in Washington and Oregon newspapers at the time it was on a summer night in July, 1924 that a small cabin housing a group of miners came under attack by a gang of wild “apemen.” According to the five miners, all of whom survived the incident and seemed convinced of its facts, they were asleep when the attack started. Seemingly out of nowhere the cabin they had hand built began being hit by huge stones that were being thrown by “Mountain Devils” on all sides. The men began to shoot at the monsters and the attacks would cease only to start back up again minutes later. At one point one of the supposed Sasquatch reached into the cabin through a hole in the construction and took hold of an axe, but was stymied before he could pull it out of the building.The siege continued until daybreak when the men finally inched their way out of the cabin. One of the men, Fred Beck, saw one of the Bigfoot standing in the distance at the edge of what is now Ape Canyon. Beck fired on the creature supposedly watching it tumble into the gorge.Beck would go on to write a book about their experience that night, speculating that the apemen were in fact extradimensional beings, but some more grounded theories have also been posited. The most popular explanation for the sensational story is that it was a gang of local youth that were bombarding the cabin with rocks as youths are want to do. Thanks to the acoustics of the canyon it is possible that their voices were made to seem beastly, or extradimensional as it were.The site of the cabin is no longer known, but Ape Canyon continues to be a popular hiking destination despite being significantly altered by the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. It seems that not hoards of otherworldly bigfoots nor active volcanoes can keep people away from this lovely spot. ",This scenic gorge is named after one of the most famous Bigfoot attacks in pseudohistory. ,"D.B.

Baroque design patterns adorn some of the support rafters and the altar is well-known for its idiosyncratic carvings as well. Most other turf structures from the time were relatively ascetic in their design, making Grafarkirkja stick out among its fellow historical sites as being of particular beauty.The church was actually deconsecrated not long after its construction and for years it was used as a tool shed. Despite this, the ancient turf oratory survived remarkably well across the centuries but eventually the National Museum of Iceland had the structure entirely rebuilt to its original condition in 1950.

829,Miami Circle,"lost tribes,long now locations,ruins",310,892,"Property developer Michael Bauman was in for a real surprise when he purchased a plot of land in downtown Miami in 1998. Bauman’s plans for the land were seemingly simple: demolish a 1950-era apartment complex and build a luxury condominium in its place.During a routine archaeological survey of the site, however, hundreds of mysterious holes were discovered in a layer of Oolitic limestone bedrock and Bauman’s development plans immediately came to a halt. Through further investigation, twenty-four of the largest holes comprised a perfect circle, 38 feet (12 m) in diameter, and excavation results found a variety of artifacts ranging from human teeth to ancient tools.Included in the artifacts were pieces of burnt wood which, after being tested for radiocarbon dating, are believed to be 1800-2000 years old. To date, Miami Circle is the only known evidence in the United States of a prehistoric structure built into bedrock. Evidence from this mysterious prehistoric “footprint” predates other known settlements along the East Coast.The site is believed to have once been occupied by the Tequesta Indians, a local tribe whose known tools matched some of the shark tooth-related artifacts found during excavation. Theorists have suggested that the holes were structural postholes or part of the foundation for a building. Some believe the building was used for ceremonial purposes, as animal bones and unused tools appeared to be offerings.Among these tools were two axe-heads made from basalt, a hard stone that is not indigenous to Florida. The finding of these tools contradicts the theory that the site was occupied by the Tequesta, however, as the volcanic rock is believed to have been from a location in Macon, Georgia - some 600 miles (970 km) away from the site.The mysterious origin of the site has led to its nickname as “America’s Stonehenge”, (though there are a number of sites nicknamed this) and some critics and conspiracy theorists have offered alternative theories. Aliens, Mayans and septic tanks are among some of the suggested origins for the holes.The State of Florida eventually purchased the land from Baumann after a series of high-profile disputes between Native American groups, contractors, and historic preservation committees. Miami Circle, otherwise known as Brickell Point or the Miami River Circle, was declared a National Historic Landmark in early 2009 and is currently under a 44-year lease agreement with the Historical Museum of Southern Florida. Visitors interested in the history of the Miami Circle can view artifacts on display through the museum’s permanent exhibition: “First Arrivals: The Archaeology of Southern Florida.”Currently, the actual post holes composing the Miami circle are covered with sod and flagstones, to preserve the site.

Over 100 sculptures created from salvaged items fill Schaper’s Museum of Kinetic Art in Tucson, Arizona.Old rocking horses. Discarded diving boards. An old drum machine. What used to be trash has been repurposed as art by Schaper, a sculptor, poet, and performance artist whose kinetic sculptures were first seen as part of his theater projects and in other exhibitions across the country before settling into their permanent home at the museum in 1983.Schaper says he doesn’t necessarily have a plan when he begins assembling his found materials. Instead, he “look[s] at things that come to me and wait for things to fit together.” This results in moveable creations that are unpredictable and unique. The objects aren’t just meant for observation, however.  The pieces are transformed from sculpture into sets, props, costumes, and characters for Schaper’s one-man theater.

Elsewhere in the region though, there are other, less well-known parks and reserves that still offer a chance to explore unique environments and escape into the wilderness.One such example is Kodachrome Basin State Park. Situated between Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef National Parks, it’s relatively easy to reach, but far enough off the main road that many travelers may miss it. The highlight amid the beautiful landscape the dozens of unique spires of sandstone that fill the park. Unlike the hoodoos of Bryce or the cliffs in Capitol Reef, these sedimentary monoliths are each individual chunks of rock, left standing like sentinels by the action of the wind.There are 67 spires spread around the park, and visitors can walk around and among them, as well as into the deep gullies scoured out by millennia of erosion. The hills surrounding the park are steep enough that vegetation cannot cling to them, leaving the vibrant colors of the sedimentary rock underneath exposed.These shades are so intense and varied, they are what gave the park its name. In 1948 a National Geographic Society expedition applied for special permission from the Kodak company to use the name of their film to celebrate the beauty of the park.Walking around the neatly marked trails, hikers are able to enjoy quiet isolation from the bustling crowds, taking in views of the delicate interplay of the plant life barely clinging to the thin soil and sheer rock. A 4x4 trail leads to Grosvenor Arch, a sandstone arch comparable with those seen in the more famous Arches National Park.The remoteness of the park also presents the opportunity to camp under some of the darkest skies imaginable. The high altitude, clear desert air and lack of light pollution combine to give incredible views of the night sky. Campers prepared to brave a cold desert morning can take in the sunrise over the desert plains, a view that cannot have changed significantly in the thousands of years humans have lived in the area.",This quiet park's strange sedimentary spires were named after Kodak's color film. ,"Bryce Canyon,Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument ,The Cassidy Trail","Kodachrome State Park Rd Henrieville, Utah United States",37.5178,-111.994,robembersonshaw95culturetrekking,2017-10-25 00:00:00,"Bryce Canyon,Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument ,The Cassidy Trail,The Wahweap Hoodoos","Painted Dunes ,Fairy Glen,The Pinnacles,Looking Glass Rock",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kodachrome-basin-spires

Although a fire destroyed over 50 buildings in 1861, the town rebuilt and reached its peak around 1880 with a population of over 1,000.But with the area’s gold veins almost tapped out, Nevadaville’s best days were already behind it. By the 1920s and ’30s, the town was a shadow of its former self, and by the second half of the 20th century the population had declined to just a handful of individuals. 1950s census data shows just six residents living in the town. Today, Nevadaville is mostly deserted, with just two determined residents still calling Nevadaville home.Several original buildings are still standing in Nevadaville, including a saloon building, city hall, and a Masonic lodge that, strangely enough, still holds regular meetings.

These remains in the southeastern Utah desert once comprised a religious colony that set out to be a post-apocalyptic utopia, formed in 1933 by a wealthy widow from New Jersey.Marie Ogden’s interest in the occult started when her husband passed away. Grief-stricken, she turned to religion for answers and had a spiritual revelation.She opened the “Truth Center” in New Jersey and began claiming that God was speaking through her via divine manipulation, dictating messages through her typewriter. One of these messages was to go build God’s kingdom, and spiritual signs pointed to a plot of land called Dry Valley, near Church Rock in San Juan County, Utah.Ogden and her handful of followers believed the world was coming to an end and all would be destroyed except for this barren place, which would be the site of Christ’s second coming. Ogden envisioned a peaceful community of religious settlers that would survive the apocalypse and start anew.The commune consisted of about 20 buildings broken into three so-called portals. The Inner Portal was the heart of the settlement, where Ogden lived. She maintained a newspaper to spread the message that God was sending through her typewriter.  The religious settlers, in addition to pledging to do whatever God dictated through Ogden, lived without personal belongings and adhered to strict rules forbidding alcohol, tobacco, meat and other comforts.The community grew from a couple dozen to about 100 followers in 1935, but within two years only seven diehards were left. The decline started as word of the cult’s strange rituals began to spread, and the breaking point came when a woman who was promised a cure for cancer died, and Ogden refused to bury her, insisting she would come back alive. Instead cult members kept the body preserved and even fed it milk and and eggs for two months after the woman’s death.This unsurprisingly created a huge backlash among the neighboring communities which, compounded with more of Ogden’s prophecies failing to come true, led people to abandoned the cult. The commune was all but dissolved by the end of the 1930s.The land became private property after Ogden’s death in 1975, but the remains of the Home of Truth can still be found there today. The property owner made a point of preserving the Inner Portal, and plans to restore the site and open it to the public. Visitors can glimpse the abandoned buildings from the road, and the gate to the entrance of the Inner Portal, where for years, over the gate hung a sign that read “Marie’s Place.”",This ghost town was once a cult-like religious utopian settlement. ,"Church Rock,Newspaper Rock,Hole n"" the Rock","195 UT-211 Monticello, Utah, 84535 United States",38.0608,-109.3841,mollyfairclothMrCarlshaw95WhiskeyBristles,2016-08-29 00:00:00,"Church Rock,Newspaper Rock,Hole n"" the Rock,Paradox Valley","Iosepa Ghost Town,El Palmar de Troya ,Johnsonville Village,Mount Banahaw",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/home-of-truth

The Niagara escarpment — named for Niagara Falls located toward its eastern end — takes a 625-mile trip from Rochester, New York, horse-shoeing around Hamilton, Ontario, up through the Bruce Peninsula, across Manitoulin Island, Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, eastern Wisconsin, and finally dipping down along the western side of Lake Michigan in northern Illinois.Along the way it meanders through Hamilton, Ontario, leaving behind over 130 waterfalls and cascades within the city limits.   Hamilton prides itself on being the City of Waterfalls, celebrating its moniker with festivals, books, artwork, a waterfall fan group, Facebook pages, and waterfall-themed hikes, walks and adventures. The Niagara Escarpment cutting through the middle of the city provides the best possible setting for falls of all shapes and sizes, from the crashing waters of Webster’s Falls, to the 120-foot pour into the Devils Punchbowl, to the steady tiered cascade of Princess Falls.None of the drops in Hamilton are as dramatic as their flashy cousin to the east, but the diversity and sheer number within a single city of 430 square miles is awfully impressive.

Consisting of thousands of smallish, three-toed footprints, the site represents one of the largest collection of dino prints in the United States. The tracks are remarkably preserved with the very pattern of the dinosaur’s (believed to have been a type of Dilophosuarus) skin in the tracks. In order to preserve the precious specimens, a couple of measures were taken. A large geodesic dome was built over a grouping of around 500 of the prints so that visitors could come see them first hand. The dome is also built to act as a museum complete with replica dinos. The remaining 1,500 or so tracks were then reburied so that they might be preserved for future generations.In addition to the dome museum, the rest of the acres of parkland surrounding it act as an arboretum that has set out to plant as much flora that has root in the Mesozoic era as they can.

837,Denali,"state high points,geographic markers,mountains",835,891,"The pinnacle of Alaska, the United States, and North America at 20,237 feet above sea level, Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is the end goal of highpointers, a tempting target for mountaineers all over the world, and a symbol of those who just need to climb a mountain to leave their mark on the world.The staggering massif of Mount Denali is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve, just off the Denali Highway in Denali Borough. Denali means “The Great One” in the Athabaskan, and mountaineers and Alaskans refer to it as Denali as well. Thus, why wouldn’t the U.S. government? Well for most of it’s modern history, it’s because of president stuff. The mountain received its presidential name in 1896 when a gold panner, William Dickey, wrote a story for the New York Sun about his experiences in the area, and he wrote about the behemoth mountain that “We named our great peak Mount McKinley, after William McKinley of Ohio, who had been nominated for the Presidency.” Some would say that Dickey met many silver prospectors who were in favor of McKinley’s opponent, William Jennings Bryan, who advocated a silver standard of currency, instead of McKinley who favored the gold standard.Not wanting the mountain to be forever named out of spite, Governor Jay Hammond and the Alaska Legislature in 1975 asked the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to rename the mountain to Denali, but the then Secretary of the Interior held off the request for two years. Then, longtime Representative from President McKinley’s home district of Canton, Ohio, Ralph Regula, maneuvered to keep the name the same. President Carter had the new national park named Denali in 1980 as a compromise, but at the very beginning of every congressional term since, Representative Regula would introduce legislation to keep the name the same, stymieing it for two more years. He would repeat this strategy until he retired in 2009, when two more Ohio Representatives, Betty Sutton and Tim Ryan, introduced H.R. 229, repeating the strategy for the foreseeable future.In 2015, President Obama officially renamed the mountain Mount Denali. Whatever name one refers to this mountain, including the nickname “Mount Mid-Life Crisis” by some mountaineers, Denali is one of the premier climbs in the world. It rises 17,000 feet above the surrounding plain, the highest relief of any mountain from above sea level. Many snow and glacier routes with many variations ascend to the South Peak. The standard route in recent years is the West Buttress Route, a 16-mile route with over 12,000 feet of elevation gain. The climbing season for this route is May through mid-July. May brings colder temperatures down to -40 at times and blistering wind speeds, but more stable weather. Later in the months, weather gets warmer but punishing snowstorms develop more often. All climbers on this mountain must be in the best shape of their lives, be well-versed in snow and glacier climbing, and be prepared to spend three weeks on their expedition in a very hostile environment.For those who just wish to capture the mountain rising above the wild lands below, many pullouts are available along Parks Highway, Alaska Route 3, to stop and take a picture. The park’s shuttle bus system also provides a 6-hour bus ride to Wonder Lake and Reflection Pond, which provides spectacular photograph opportunities on a clear day, to see the grand mountain rise above an entire continent.",The king of U.S. high points towers over every other peak on the continent.  ,"Independence Mine,Igloo City,Dr. Seuss House aka The Goose Creek Tower","Parks Hwy Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska United States",63.0692,-151.007,thomasharperzac1zacmimiparisCollector of ExperiencesIJVin,2014-08-12 00:00:00,"Igloo City,Dr. Seuss House aka The Goose Creek Tower,Independence Mine,Castle House","Mount Rainier,Mount Hood,Gannett Peak,Granite Peak",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/denali

Parks were included in the plan at 53rd, 66th, 77th and 120th Streets. But, while the plan was effective at predicting and handling the explosive growth the city would experience over the next 150 years, it ultimately failed to provide enough parkland for recreation. To help alleviate demand, Mayor Lindsay started up the Vest Pocket Park campaign, which squeezed public space in wherever it could. The lot on 71st Street was condemned in 1969, landscaped by the city and eventually handed over to the stewardship of the NYC Parks Department in 1981. As for its name? It’s Latin for “seventy-one,” and was appended by parks commissioner Henry J. Stern in 2000 after a $14,325 renovation.

In cold weather, they glisten with snow. But come rain or shine, a sentinel stands guard in the island’s major city, Sapporo. Loyal, friendly, and steadfast, this is Ken-kun, the proprietor of the Inu no Yakiimoyasan sweet potato stand. This friendly salesman greets visitors and welcomes them to sample his signature roasted sweet potatoes. But a sign outside the stand reminds visitors that he can’t give you change—because he’s a dog. The Dog’s Roasted Sweet Potato stand has been around for several years, reliably offering locals in a Sapporo residential district the common street snack. Ken-kun, a Shiba Inu, rocketed to global fame following a viral tweet early in 2019, and the internet was delighted at what a good boy he was. While Ken-kun can’t actually roast the sweet potatoes or handle the money—that lack of opposable thumbs can really hold an entrepreneur back—he does man the stand solo for most of the day. His owner roasts the potatoes and leaves them in a plastic container, then comes around several times a day to count the cash in an honor-system money box and walk Ken-kun. But for the most part, the dog is an independent go-getter. Ken-kun enjoys the enviable status of the only known dog currently manning a Japanese food stand, but he’s not the only Shiba Inu who’s been in on the hustle. That honor also goes to the businesslike assistant shopkeeper at Tokyo’s Suzuki tobacco stand, who retired after three years on the job. Ken-kun, however, gets the award for selling a decidedly more nutritious product, and for inspiring honesty in the hearts of visitors to the honor-system stand through his wholesome presence alone. Update as of June 2021: Ken-kun has sadly passed away. ",The only thing sweeter than the potatoes is the canine proprietor of this roadside stall.  ,"Shimizusawa Thermal Power Plant,Hachikyo,Moerenuma Park","1-chome-15-11 Kiyota  2 Jo Kiyota-ku Sapporo, 0040842",43.0037,141.4282,Reina Gattusogkiuchi,2020-01-06 00:00:00,"Hachikyo,Moerenuma Park,Shimizusawa Thermal Power Plant,Jigokudani (Hell Valley)","Kennel Road,Nipper, the RCA Dog Statue,Lion's Head,Sergeant Stubby Statue",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/inu-no-yakiimoyasan-dog-sweet-potato

One of the most lovely, and possibly the largest of them is Colorado’s Great Stupa of Dharmakaya. The giant stupa, located in the Shambala Mountain Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado might be a tranquil memorial today, but its construction was anything but smooth. Construction on the stupa began in 1988 after the death of Buddhist meditation master Chögyam Trungpa, who had founded the Mountain Center. The monument was meant as both a memorial for the teacher and as a symbol of global peace. However the stupa was not actually completed until 13 years later, when it was finally consecrated in 2001.Now that it is finished, the towering stupa stands 108 feet tall, and it is said to have been built with a special concrete mix that is meant to last for a thousand years. The interior of the monument contains three levels, and unlike most stupas, which are generally sealed, the Great Stupa is open, although only the first level is accessible by the public. The entire structure is covered in symbolic flourishes and statuary, including a large golden buddha statue in the center, and a spire made of 13 discs representing levels of enlightenment.The Great Stupa of Dharmakaya is the crown jewel of the Shambala Mountain Center, and an inspiring symbol of peace.

Almost perfectly spherical about two or three feet in diameter, stones like these have caused wild speculation wherever they’ve been discovered, with answers from aliens to dinosaurs, but the answer is actually simple geology.Best observed at low tide, the so-called bowling balls are actually a geological phenomenon known as “concretion,” sedimentary rock formed by a natural process wherein mineral cements bind grains of sand or stone into larger formations. These boulders are the result of millions of years of concretion and erosion, exposing the hard spheres as the mudstone of the cliffs receded around them.Although rare, this same phenomenon is what created the extraordinary Moeraki Boulders and Koutu Boulders in New Zealand, Cannonball River in North Dakota, Valley of Balls in Kazakhstan, as well as elsewhere in the world.A peculiar story stands behind the Schooner Gulch name.

The ruins of Saint Nicholas’ Church, which dates to sometime between the 12th and 13th centuries, still stand. Local legend has it that Saint Nicholas—a.k.a Father Christmas, the inspiration behind Santa Claus—is buried within a cracked, carved tomb in its grounds.According to local tradition, two Norman crusaders nabbed the saint’s remains while heading home to Kilkenny from the Holy Land over 800 years ago. Saint Nicholas’ supposed tombstone depicts a cleric with the heads of two knights peering over his shoulder, which represent the knights who carried the bones. Though it’s true that Norman knights from the area were part of the crusades, the theory that they stole and relocated Father Christmas isn’t widely accepted by non-locals.Newtown Jerpoint existed until sometime in the 17th century. Though it was once a bustling village with over a dozen taverns, the loss of its toll bridge and the re-routing of the local road eventually caused its residents to abandon it.Now, the ruined church and tomb exist within the privately owned Jerpoint Park, a working farm that offers tours, fishing, and sheep dog demonstrations.",Local legend says the remains of Father Christmas lie within the medieval grounds. ,"Kells Priory,Jerpoint Abbey,Cantwell Fada","L4206 Ireland 52.5103, -7.1680Visit Website NearbyJerpoint Abbey0.42 milesCantwell Fada3.69 milesKells Priory4.58 miles",52.5103,-7.168,listeningdaisyCollector of ExperiencesMrCarl,2017-07-27 00:00:00,"Jerpoint Abbey,Cantwell Fada,Kells Priory,Tullaherin Folk Museum and Round Tower","Basilica of St. John,St. John's Church ,St. Bridget's Kirk,Sanctuary of Santa Vittoria",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-lost-town-of-newtown-jerpoint-kilkenny-ireland
845,Mars Cheese Castle,"shops,food,architectural oddities,architecture",1400,891,"Some people eat cheese. Others make it. Still others sell it. And some, like the Ventura family, honor it with a  magnificent roadside castle.Since 1957 the Mars Cheese Castle has proudly dispensed a wide selection of cheese and related products to travelers looking to take home a memento of their journey through Wisconsin. Originally opened as a gas station in 1947 (which burned to the ground 10 years later), Mars Cheese Castle eventually grew to become the largest, oldest, showiest  purveyor at the junction of 1-94 and Wisconsin Highway 142, a spot once dubbed “Wisconsin’s most visible cheese interchange” by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The store was named not after the planet but after the original owner, Mario Ventura Sr., though this detail hasn’t stopped the venue from incorporating a small touch of outer space into its castle motif (see logo).In 2011, plans to widen I-94 forced Mars Cheese Castle to abandon the storefront it had used for over 50 years. Rather than mourn the loss of their beloved fortress, the proprietors used the opportunity to update the store’s image. Whereas the turrets on the former building’s facade merely suggested a castle, the new, larger store, outfitted with a drawbridge and a watchtower, is an abode truly fit for a king (of cheese). In exchange for its willingness to relocate, the state agreed to allow Mars Cheese Castle to keep its iconic sign, which, at 80 feet tall, violates current height restrictions for signs along the interstate.Though cheese is, of course, the main attraction, Mars Cheese Castle also sells a variety of meats, bakery items, and cheese-themed knick-knacks, including the state’s most essential souvenir, the famed Wisconsin cheese-head hat.",Wisconsin's most celebrated export gets the royal treatment on I-94. ,"Orson Welles Birthplace,Richard Bong State Recreation Area,Franks Diner","2800 West Frontage Road Kenosha, Wisconsin, 53144 United States",42.615,-87.9528,Leslie McIntyrejessicahawkMartinCollector of Experiencespaigeelizabeth3660,2013-08-13 00:00:00,"Franks Diner,Orson Welles Birthplace,Richard Bong State Recreation Area,The Golden Rondelle ","Gibeau Orange Julep,Garden Santa Fe,Sewoon Sangga (Sewoon Plaza),Arctic Circle Centre",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mars-cheese-castle

Building proprietor Max Glucksman was a leading figure in the world of tango in his own right, as owner of the influential Nacional-Odeon record label. In 1929, the theater underwent its first transformation to become a cinema, with the distinction of being the first in Buenos Aires to show sound film.Glucksman’s love of tango carried over to the new cinema, with live tango orchestration accompanying the silent films projections. Architect Fernando Manzone oversaw the building’s most recent conversion into the El Ateneo bookstore and music shop, to the tune of AR $3 million. Just prior to the leasing of the building to Grupo Ilhsa in 2000, the Grand Splendid was under threat of demolition due to a poor economy.Though some lament the loss of a beloved cinema, it is now thanks to the Grupo Ilhsa—which owns 40 bookshops, including the flagship Grand Splendid location—that visitors can still revel in this wondrous monument of a bygone era. While the selection of books on offer is standard chain store fare and mostly in Spanish, bibliophiles will find the staggeringly opulent display of books to be reason enough to pay El Ateneo Grand Splendid a visit. To fully bask in the splendor, one can also indulge in coffee and live piano music on the very stage where the Argentinean stars of tango once performed.","This historic, palatial theater is now one of the world’s most beautiful bookstores. ","Original Tomb of Tomás Guido,The Tomb of Rufina Cambacérès ,Cementerio de la Recoleta",1860 Ave. Santa Fe Buenos Aires Argentina,-34.5958,-58.3941,morinagaSeth TeicherCollector of ExperiencesnanpalmeroNicholas JacksonMark CaseynanpalmeroCollector of ExperiencesssashaNicholas JacksonMark CaseySeth Teicher,2011-02-07 00:00:00,"Original Tomb of Tomás Guido,Cementerio de la Recoleta,The Tomb of Rufina Cambacérès ,Ricardo Rojas House Museum","Barter Books,Yangzhou Zhongshuge,Hollywood Theater,Hollywood Theatre",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/el-ateneo-grand-splendid
847,Gay City State Park,"mills,ghost towns,parks,cemeteries,abandoned,ruins,history",217,890,"Located in Hebron, Connecticut, in what is now called the Gay City State Park, Gay City was created because of a religious feud. Gay City was an 18th century village so named after one of the founders, John Gay. In fact, most of the people living in the city were related to John Gay and bore the same surname.The main beefs that many of the Gays had with the people of Hartford, from whence they came, was that they were Methodists and liked their alcohol, while most of Hartford were Congregationalists and while not teetotalers, took a more austere view of liquor, unlike the Gay family. In fact, only 15 years after the town was settled in 1796, the family built their own distillery. It really was a “gay” town after that. The inhabitants used the river to power several mills including a lumber mill and a textile mill, which were major sources of income for the community.Gay City appears on the ghost hunter radar for some strange murders that took place. One story goes that a local peddler disappeared and then his skeleton was found in the local charcoal burner’s charcoal pit. It is believed that he was murdered by the charcoal burner, but no one was ever prosecuted.Another strange murder was that of a young blacksmith’s apprentice who happened to come to work a little late, and by some stories, a little drunk. The blacksmith, enraged at the lateness, stabbed him, then cut off his head. A little severe for tardiness, but the strange part is no one was arrested for this murder either.The town was a thriving community until the late 1800s when the mill burned down (for a third time) and people started leaving. They left their houses, shops, and factories and moved away. The town was a ghost town abandoned to the woods of Connecticut. The land belonged to one of the sole surviving members of the Gay family, Emma Foster, who gave it to the state under the stipulation it be called Gay City State park and that whatever remained of the town structures, and graveyard, should not be purposely torn down.Today the park has hiking trails, a campsite, picnic areas, and a swimming area by the pond. If you like exploring abandoned spaces, combined with cross country hiking, this place is a gem.If you walk along the hiking trails you will come across the abandoned ruins of the old town, namely the thrice-burned mill. Stone farm fences lace the woods in orderly rectangles, and if you are willing to leave the trails and hike aimlessly through the woods you will see stone remnants of the houses and other buildings, including cellars, chimneys, and foundations.Most of the original structures were built of wood and have long rotted away, but the eerie ghosts of them remain as outlines in the undergrowth and new forest brush. The graveyard still exists. The now mostly unreadable gravestones are often ornamented with gifts from hikers. Small teddy bears can be found at the graves of children, and flowers and other mementos adorn various headstones.",The ruins of an abandoned 18th-century town that is slowly being reclaimed by the forest. ,"Snake Rock,Nike Missile Site HA-26,Union Pond Mill","387-509 CT-85 Hebron, Connecticut United States",41.7225,-72.4362,e1savagerelizheadiewerjeffery,2018-05-21 00:00:00,"Snake Rock,Union Pond Mill,Nike Missile Site HA-26,Cogswell Memorial Fountain","Bankhead Ghost Town,Ruins of Antuni,The Lost Town of Proctor,Elberton Ghost Town",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gay-city-state-park

Since then, the pay-as-you-go park has become overrun with rust and nature, rendering it unsalvageable, but remained largely intact. Smiling characters have become creepily content in their shabby, weather-worn condition, and trees and bushes grow up and into what were once majestic coasters. What once attracted families full of smiling children now attracts brave urban explorers and nesting birds. Sleeping Beauty’s castle, once a place of fairytales, now resembles something out of a haunted nightmare.While the park still seems to be powered by electricity, the cost of bringing these monolithic coasters back to life is too high, yet the fate of the park remains uncertain. Guards regularly patrol the grounds fining trespassers, but no plans to demolish are currently in the works.

855,F. Scott Fitzgerald's Boarding House,"literature,cemeteries",348,1036,"Published in a 1929 issue of the New Yorker,  F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Short Autobiography,” chronicles life in a way most appropriate to the inventor of the Jazz Age: as a series of cocktails.  According to this “autobiography,” the Big Easy’s famous “sazzarac (sic) cocktail ” is the main event of 1919, “brought up from New Orleans to Montgomery to celebrate an important occasion.” And in 1919, Fitzgerald certainly had cause for celebration.After This Side of Paradise had been given the green light by Charles Scribner’s Sons for publication, Fitzgerald visited Montgomery, home of the feisty Zelda Sayre, whose romantic interest Fitzgerald renewed by promise of his novel’s success.In mid-January of 1920, while editing proofs of his soon-to-be-hit, the flapper-scribe rented a room at 2900 Prytania, then a cheap boarding house in New Orleans’ Garden District. Though Fitzgerald resided at 2900 Prytania for less than a month, locals like to claim him as one of their own – an affection likely born of their shared love of booze and jazz. This Side of Paradise was published shortly after Fitzgerald’s departure from New Orleans. Celebrity secured, Fitzgerald and Sayre resumed their engagement, embarking on a tumultuous love affair whose beginning coincided with that of the Jazz Age.        Now a private home, Fitzgerald’s quarters would have overlooked beautiful Lafayette Cemetery, just a wafting distance from New Orleans’ famous old eatery, Commander’s Palace.  Visitors to the Garden District can still gaze up at the windows of this former boarding house, where Sazerac-fueled visions of new love and a dawning Jazz Age once danced in the eyes of America’s greatest novelists. ",A house of courtship where the Jazz Age's most storied lovers got their start. ,"Lafayette Cemetery,Buckner Mansion,House of Broel","2900 Prytania Street & 6th Street New Orleans, Louisiana, 70115 United States",29.9288,-90.0864,Lady Delaneycait7911megpiemskabaserviceicatsstaciLizi Bmmegpieccait7911CDVV86mmskabaserviceicatsstaciLLizi Blittlebrumble,2015-09-30 00:00:00,"Lafayette Cemetery,House of Broel,Buckner Mansion, The Eiffel Tower of New Orleans","Thomas Wolfe's Angel,Grave of Beauford Delaney,Canongate Kirkyard,George Orwell's Grave",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/f-scott-fitzgerald-s-boarding-house

She was the first cloned mammal ever to be created from an adult cell.The sheep was a scientific marvel. Her successful arrival into the world brought her international fame within the scientific community. Before Dolly, the idea of cloning an adult mammal was pure science fiction.Dolly was created from the mammary gland of a sheep. It’s how she got her name. The animal was named after country singer Dolly Parton who, as one of the men responsible for creating the sheep said, has her own famously impressive pair of mammary glands.Dolly was born on July 5th, 1996 at the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute. Despite the fact that her life began in a test tube and she technically had three moms (one sheep provided the egg, another the DNA, and another carried her embryo), she lived a fairly normal life. She was even allowed to breed, and birthed six lambs of her own. Sadly, she died in 2003 after developing tumors in her lungs.You can pay your respects to the famous sheep by popping into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh to view her stuffed remains. She is fairly easily to spot in her rotating plexiglass cubicle, located in the Science and Technology Gallery.

858,"The Old Headquarters of Murder, Inc. ","crime,crime and punishment,shops",118,887,"On the corner of Saratoga and Livonia Avenues in Brownsville, Brooklyn, there used to be a 24 hour candy store. During the 1930s and 40s, the Midnight Rose Candy Store, located under the elevated portion of the 3 subway train, was run by a little old lady in her 60s, Mrs. Rosie Gold. It’s hard to imagine a more innocuous and unoffending picture. But all was not as it seemed at the Midnight Rose, for this was the secret headquarters of one of the most infamous and deadly groups in the history of organized crime: Murder, Inc. Murder Incorporated was created in the 1930s to act as the execution squad of the newly formed National Crime Syndicate. The death squad was comprised of mostly Jewish and Italian gangsters centered around the Brownsville neighbourhood of Brooklyn. Exact numbers aren’t known, but it is estimated that Murder Inc., carried out 400-1000 executions, making the innocent looking candy store responsible for more murders than anywhere else in the United States. The National Crime Syndicate was the ruling elite of East Coast organized crime, counting amongst their ruthless members Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel and Dutch Shultz. Murder Inc. was run by  Louis “Lepke” Buchalter and Albert Anastasia, known as the ‘Lord High Executioner’. The group of killers were paid a basic retaining salary and a freelancer fee for each hit of anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000. Rosie Gold kept a wall of pay phones along the back wall of the candy store; the members of Murder Inc., would pass the time at the Midnight Rose, sipping on Rosie’s malted milks until one of the phones rang, giving the details of the hit.The group included such cold blooded killers as Abe “Kid Twist” Reles, “Pittsburgh Phil” Strauss, Allie “Tic Toc” Tannenbaum, and Martin “Buggsy” Goldstein. As the murders were carried out by men unknown to the victims, Murder Inc., was able to remain unassociated with executions that took place all along the East Coast, and as far west as Detroit. Strangers were often dispatched at the whim of the National Crime Syndicate with the preferred weapon of choice for Murder Inc., the ice pick. The assassins eventually met their downfall in 1940 when “Kid Twist” Reles was caught by a police informant. Ratting on each of his colleagues, the majority of members of Murder Inc., would go on to meet their own grisly ends in the electric chair at Sing Sing. On November 12th, 1941, whilst staying at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island under 24 hour police supervision, Kid Twist was found dead after falling seven stories from his room. The case was never solved, but it seems likely that he paid the price for turning informant. As one member of the National Crime Syndicate is supposed to have said of Reles, “the canary could sing, but he couldn’t fly.”With most of its members in prison or executed, Murder Inc., faded into memory; but is immortalized in film, literature, and television shows such as “Boardwalk Empire” and Neil Kleid & Jake Allen’s comic book “Brownsville” (2006), their name has passed into legend.Rosie Gold disappeared into obscurity, but her corner candy store is still there, on the corner of Saratoga and Livonia. For the past three years it has been a 24 hour bodega. The current owner when interviewed had no idea that his corner deli was once the headquarters of one of  the most feared collection of assassins in American history. The row of telephones have gone, and with it the ring of an incoming call that would have meant the end of someone’s life at the deadly hands of Murder Incorporated. ",This otherwise innocuous bodega was once the headquarters of the most feared assassin's guild in American history. ,"Canarsie Trolley Graveyard,Wyckoff House,Weeksville Heritage Center","Livonia and Saratoga Avenues Brownsville Brooklyn, New York, 11212",40.6616,-73.9155,Luke J Spencerbertcrabbeljbrown,2014-11-18 00:00:00,"Weeksville Heritage Center,Wyckoff House,Canarsie Trolley Graveyard,770 Eastern Parkway","The Last Resort Bar,The Star Tavern,Old Tai O Police Station,Napier Prison",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-old-headquarters-of-murder-inc-brooklyn-new-york

Yet in reality, it is simply a community that expresses their spirituality through homemade art installations rife with Masonic imagery.Legends about the off-the-beaten path neighborhood abound among the local teens. Ranging from raving voodoo priests to ghosts to very real, baseball bat wielding maniacs. These strange tales are thanks in no small part to the countless brightly colored folk art pieces that decorate many of the yards and buildings. The selection of strange pieces range wildly with some of the pieces living up (down?) to the superstitions, such as a large cross with nails jutting from every angle, while others appear as simply rainbow-colored fences and ladders. There is however a distinct Masonic influence to the pieces, with the symbol of the Freemasons adorning many of the pieces. The truth of the village however is not so sinister, yet still strange.The community was started in the 1960s by a spiritual leader named Wash Harris who named the neighborhood, “St. Peter’s Spiritual Temple.” Harris’ followers seem to adhere to some form of mixed Christianity with a heavy dose of Masonic devotion. The odd lawn ornaments were created as fetishized devotionals, and the strange and possibly cultish take-over of the area did nothing to assuage the fears of the (let’s be honest, likely largely caucasian) Memphis locals who soon dubbed the area “Voodoo Village.”Today the community is still the target of near constant visits from teens and rabble-rousers looking to overcome some rite of passage, zooming in and out of the neighborhood to gawk and harass the people living there. Maybe understandably there have been verified accounts of people being chased off by baseball bat wielding residents who are absolutely not interested in being made into a regressive urban legend.",A reclusive Memphis neighborhood is home to decades worth of misunderstood Masonic folk art. ,"Isaac Hayes's Gold-Plated Cadillac,The Jungle Room at Graceland,Al Green’s Full Gospel Tabernacle Church","Memphis, Tennessee, 38109 United States 35.0205, -90.1179Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyAl Green’s Full Gospel Tabernacle Church4.55 milesThe Jungle Room at Graceland5.65 milesIsaac Hayes's Gold-Plated Cadillac8.20 miles",35.0205,-90.1179,tkillemsCollector of Experiencesreneesotomjflanagan0,2014-10-21 00:00:00,"Al Green’s Full Gospel Tabernacle Church,The Jungle Room at Graceland,Isaac Hayes's Gold-Plated Cadillac,Earnestine & Hazel's","The Lucifernum,Shelton McMurphey Johnson House,The Wood Cake House,Millennium Manor Castle ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-peter-s-spiritual-temple

Although the Great Fire caused terrible damage to the church it was faithfully rebuilt, and topped with a steeple designed by Sir Christopher Wren. But in 1941, the church was devastated by the Blitz. A direct hit destroyed everything apart from the north and south walls, and Wren’s steeple. The threat of German invasion of the United Kingdom had ended with the Battle of Britain a year earlier, but the sustained strategic bombing of the UK continued. By 1941, the Blitz was reaching its terrible crescendo. Starting on September 7th, 1940, London was bombed for nearly 60 consecutive nights. The night of December 29th saw the most ferocity, as the Luftwaffe blanketed London with bombs in what was called the Second Great Fire of London. By the end of the Blitz, over 1,000,000 London homes were destroyed, including much of the old Saxon church. After the war, with much of London in rubble, the slow rebuilding process began. But St. Dunstan-in-the-East remained in ruins. In 1967, the City of London Corporation decided to turn the bombed out shell of the church into a public garden, which remains to this day.Hidden away on a secluded side street, and long since dwarfed by the modern steel and chrome structures of the city, it remains one of London’s secret gardens.

868,Congressional Fallout Shelter at the Greenbrier Resort ,"long now locations,bunkers,cold war,nuclear,places to stay,subterranean sites,military",325,885,"Known as Project X, Project Casper, and eventually as Project Greek Island, and designed with relative luxury, this congressional fallout shelter remained a state secret until 1992.In the mid-1950s, the United States government covertly arranged to build a fallout shelter to house the entire U.S. Congress underneath the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, WV. Using the building of a new hotel addition—paid for by the Eisenhower administration—as a cover, the government set out to build a Congress deep beneath the ground. As part of this Faustian deal, the five-star hotel agreed that in case of nuclear war—or even just a realistic threat—the entire hotel would be commandeered by the government, hot tubs and all.A post-nuclear seat of congressional government, this was truly intended to house only the congressmen and their aids. It was not designed to accommodate their spouses or children, who would presumably have to find shelter somewhere else.To help ensure its secrecy the bunker was operated by a dummy company known as Forsythe Associates and workers on the bunker all dressed as hotel audiovisual employees. Any calls going in and out of the bunker were routed through the hotel switchboard so it looked as if they originated from and were going to the Resort.The shelter was fully equipped and among the standard bunk beds, televisions, and furniture that populate the “Graceland of Atomic Tourism,” there are a few very curious items. Among these are a special room meant for holding and calming members of Congress who can’t handle the stress, and an incinerator meant for “pathological waste,” or the Congresspeople’s irradiated bodies. A huge 100-foot radio tower installed approximately four miles away was connected to the bunker so that the congressmen could broadcast emergency messages.Completed in 1958, the shelter is no longer operative since its location was revealed in a 1992 Washington Post article.Currently, the shelter houses the offices of a data storage company, but for three decades it was fully stocked with food, furniture, and even current magazines. The shelter even had two mock chambers of Congress, complete with flags, microphones, and pictures of the founding fathers, all equipped to carry on U.S. government operations in case of nuclear war.There are now guided tours throughout the week.",America's post-nuclear-attack chambers of Congress. ,"Hanging Rock Raptor Observatory,Humpback Bridge,Lost World Caverns","300 W Main St White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, 24986 United States",37.7861,-80.3075,LeahCRindy99MagnumPIThe Awkward GlobetrotterRoadUnraveledNicholas Jackson,2010-07-15 00:00:00,"Lost World Caverns,Humpback Bridge,Hanging Rock Raptor Observatory,Pearl S.

A spiraling walkway, surrounded by greenery, slowly winds its way up and around a 100-foot-tall copper beech tree. The only thing more impressive are the incredible views from the top.The Rügen Natural Heritage Center (Naturerbe Zentrum Rügen) is located on the eastern side of the island of Rügen, Germany’s largest island by area. Famous for its national parks, beech tree forests, and chalk cliffs, it’s a prime destination for nature lovers, trekkers, and people looking to relax at the island’s seaside resorts.One of the most popular attractions is the spiraling treetop tower. The summit of the 131-foot-tall nest rises up above the surrounding woodlands to a total height of 270 feet above sea level. From the top of the wood and steel structure, visitors have a stunning view of the landscape. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the church steeples of Stralsund on the mainland, and the pylons of Rügen Bridge.Access to the tower is via a 1,367-yard-long treetop walkway (Baumwipfelpfad), which threads through the beeches until it reaches the tower. From here, visitors begin the slowly spiraling ascent around the central beech tree, which is more than 70 years old. Along the way, you can see the many insects, small animals and birds that live in this treetop environment.

Holmes,"serial killer,murder,graves,gravestones,cemeteries,history",120,886,"Section 15 of the Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania, is just off the aptly named walking path, Lazarus Avenue. Lot 41 in this section features an unmarked stone with the top tilted downward, abraded by time and general indifference. The body of one of America’s first serial killers rests 10 feet down, entombed in cement.Herman Webster Mudgett paid his way through the University of Michigan by defrauding insurance companies with cadavers from the school’s Department of Medicine and Surgery. After he graduated in 1884 he changed his name to H.H. Holmes, an homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s fictional detective, and made his way to Chicago.He worked at a drugstore, and after the owner died Holmes conned his widow into handing over the place. Eventually, using the drugstore as a front, he obtained enough money to buy the property across the street. He drew up plans for what became known as his Murder Castle.He finished the building in 1892, just as the Columbian Exposition world’s fair was getting ready nearby. The first floor was separated into storefronts, including the migrated drugstore, the third floor was sectioned into apartments, and the second floor contained soundproof rooms and a chute that went down to a crematorium in the basement.After Holmes fled Chicago in ‘93, he killed Benjamin Pitezel in another insurance scam. A detective, Frank Geyer, was simply looking into the fraudulent claims when it soon became apparent Holmes had killed Pitezel. Geyer’s findings led him to the bodies of Pitezel’s three children and eventually to the Murder Castle, sealing Holmes’ fate.On May 7, 1896, Dr. Henry Howard Holmes was hanged to death for six counts of attempted murder and four counts of first-degree murder. He requested the extra deep cement burial to prevent any potential grave robbers or medical examinations, and rumors have persisted that this was a way to avoid anyone discovering the body isn’t actually his.He was smart, charming, and handsome, and he preyed on young women, many of whom had just left home for the first time. There are claims he killed as few as nine and as many as 200 people. In prison he penned the book Holmes’ Own Story, which contends he was wrongfully accused of 22 murders. Newspapers paid him $7,500 for his confession of killing 27 people, but it was filled with contradictions and he recanted it on the gallows anyway. It did include one haunting admission: “I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.”",America's first serial killer rests in anonymity. ,"Bartram's Garden,Mount Moriah Cemetery,The Lower Swedish Cabin","626 Baily Road Yeadon, Pennsylvania United States",39.9276,-75.2574,adsummumDeirdreJ6972jamescollins74sorcha1977,2017-12-22 00:00:00,"Mount Moriah Cemetery,Bartram's Garden,The Lower Swedish Cabin,Paul Robeson House","Grave of the Unknown Man ,Grave of Sevilla Jones,Lee Chapel Cemetery,Unmarked Grave of Pierre Emile L'Angelier ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-unmarked-grave-of-hh-holmes-yeadon-pennsylvania
871,Santa Justa Lift,"elevators,engineering",1542,886,"Hills: they’re great to look at and to look from, but climbing them can be a drag.For a city like Lisbon — which has, according to its well-worn nickname, no fewer than seven hills comprising its setting — this has long been a consideration when designing intracity transportation systems. The Santa Justa Lift is a gorgeous fin de siècle solution to this problem that is still in use to this day.In the heart of Lisbon, the lower Baixa Pombalina district is separated from the higher Bairro Alto by a sudden elevation change of 45 meters (147 feet). As early as the 1870s, a lift system was proposed to facilitate the climb. First consisting of an animal-powered inclined rail lift, work began in 1900 to replace that with a vertical elevator. Inaugurated by King Carlos in 1901 and fully operational in 1902, the Santa Justa Lift has been shuttling people up and down ever since.The elegant Neo-Gothic iron tower was designed by Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, an engineer from Porto who was a student of Gustave Eiffel. Originally powered by a steam engine, the elevator motor was converted to cleaner electric operation in 1907. Lisbon still has some older funiculars (i.e., inclined tramways) still in operation, but Santa Justa is the only remaining vertical urban lift.Today, the Santa Justa Lift operates almost 16 hours a day, seven days a week, with one of its two steampunky wood-and-brass cars departing every few minutes. A platform above the upper terminus can be reached by a spiral staircase, where one can find a cafe offering commanding views of Rossio Square, the Baixa, and some of the cool stuff (like a castle!) on Lisbon’s other six hills.","This Industrial Age architectural and engineering gem helps visitors and residents alike traverse Lisbon, “The City of Seven Hills.” ","Livraria Bertrand,Carmo Convent Ruins, Hospital de Bonecas","West end of Rua de Santa Justa Lisbon, 1100-200 Portugal",38.7121,-9.1394,tylerBlindcolourXavixavirpostscriptretrofuturisticnanpalmeroArthur PendragonXavixavirhazenlandGREG MEYER mdnanpalmeroretrofuturisticBlindcolourRHyzertylercoleMMartinppostscriptJaszmina Szendrey,2016-01-05 00:00:00,"Carmo Convent Ruins,Livraria Bertrand, Hospital de Bonecas,Livraria Simão","Strutt's North Mill,Katarina Elevator ,Paternoster Lift,College of Engineering Sundial",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-justa-lift

Installed everywhere from Japan to the Wisconsin Dells, Fisher has confused and frustrated patrons throughout his entire career.With a firm belief in the excitement of being lost in a maze, Fisher has designed mazes in 30 countries, and is credited with inventing the corn maze. Along with his successes in outdoor labyrinths, since 1990, Fisher has focused his time on mirror mazes, which he considers the most challenging and filled with seemingly endless corridors. While most mazes simply have a right or wrong turn and a few dead ends, in mirror mazes “Most of the false turns are actually impossible journeys through a sheet of glass.”In 1994, Fisher designed the mirror maze in Peaugres Safari Park, which he named Labyrinthe des Dragons. The maze was constructed with angled mirrors to give the impression of endless possibilities, and reflect the lost maze adventurer. As a quirky addition, Fisher also installed live fish tanks in the maze. When reflected, the fish add a layer of movement, further confusing those wandering the labyrinth.Throughout his career, Fisher has set a number of world records and is considered an innovator in his field.

Built in 1876, it is the oldest building in Fort Sam Houston and has for over a century been both an integral Army center as well as a free and open wildlife garden.The Quadrangle was the original fort at Sam Houston, and was designed without windows to better withstand attacks. It was originally a quartermaster’s depot, storing housing supplies, and later it became an arsenal for the US Army.Then, for six weeks in 1886, the Apache leader Geronimo was held at the Quadrangle following his surrender. According to popular stories, the deer were brought to the Quadrangle to make Geronimo feel more at home. Another story has the deer being introduced for Geronimo and the thirty other captured Apaches to hunt, as they wouldn’t eat the Army food. However, the truth of why the deer and other delicate animals were brought onto the military compound remains a mystery. Whatever the real story, they have been wandering the grassy square since before Geronimo’s imprisonment.The deer, rabbits, peacocks, and other birds walk freely in the grass and under the trees here, tame enough that many of them will crowd around visitors at the sight of food. At the center of the grounds is a brick clock tower with a plaque at its top commemorating the construction of the Quadrangle, although it’s too high for anyone to read.Fort Sam Houston continues to serve as an active military base: The building is currently the headquarters for the United States Army North.","A National Historic Landmark with a scenic clock tower and park filled with deer and peacocks, plus a military museum.  ","Old Time Wooden Nickel Company,U.S. Army Medical Department Museum ,Grave of Pat the Horse","1405 E Grayson St 1400 East Grayson Street San Antonio, Texas, 78234",29.4445,-98.4614,AllisonnanpalmeroknoxiumwytheeducatetexansAnnetta Black,2010-04-30 00:00:00,"Grave of Pat the Horse,U.S. Army Medical Department Museum ,Old Time Wooden Nickel Company,'Johnny Loves Vivian' Bench ","Rathcroghan,Barzan Towers,Mystery Craters ,Marcell Experimental Forest",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-quadrangle-san-antonio-texas

It first appeared on tax rolls as far back as 1716, but it didn’t become a school until the first recorded owner got married and became the schoolmaster. With a new wife and kids to educate, the little cedar and cypress building was expanded to include a small upstairs living quarters.Despite some features that now seem antiquated (like the dungeon and privy), in other ways the school was actually ahead of its time. It was the first to be co-ed in the United States, educating both boys and girls as early as 1788.Since the mid-1930s the site has been a small museum, with displays of colonial life (including some spiffy animatronics), artifacts, early text books, and a never-completed Grove of Educators, an ambitious project intended to gather and showcase statues of educational pioneers from every country in the Americas (only a few countries participated).Meanwhile, all these years poor Timmy has been stuck in that claustrophobic little dungeon–allegedly for biting–and maybe one day they’ll let him out.

At the other end of the arm is a charmingly simple sun: a candle and a brass reflecting disc. With a turn of the crank, the system comes alive.

Bleeding, bullying, blistering salves, and electrocution were all standard treatments. This was changed under the supervision of Dr. John Galt, who believed the mentally ill were entitled to dignity and could be reintegrated with society.Galt also knew that just because the patients were crazy didn’t mean they weren’t witty. It is said that when hospital sponsor John D. Rockefeller strolled through the grounds and introduced himself to an inmate, the inmate replied, “Oh sure. And I’m Napoleon Bonaparte.” Thanks to a donation from Rockefeller, the hospital was moved about three miles west to Dunbar Farms, to accommodate its large patient population.As many as 45 enslaved workers were owned by the asylum. Galt claimed to treat patients “without regard to race,” but no records were published detailing the racial breakdown of the hospital’s patients. In 1846, he successfully submitted a bill to admit enslaved people as patients.Beginning in 1965, the College of William and Mary leased portions of Eastern State Hospital on Ironbound Road for student housing.  Five buildings and 38 acres of surrounding land were assumed by the College in 1980 and named the “Dillard Complex”.  Three miles off campus and accessible by bus, the rooms of the Dillard Complex were generally larger those on campus but very, very, creepy.  The Dillard Complex was closed in 2006 and has since been replaced by the Jamestown dorms on campus. The original buildings still stand.The reconstructed site of the original Eastern State Hospital from 1773 is owned and maintained by Colonial Williamsburg, not by the modern Eastern State Hospital, and is referred to on the Williamsburg maps as simply “Public Hospital.” A small area is dedicated to the history of the institution and includes various hospital-related artifacts and recreated patient cells that show what conditions were like.",America's first public mental health facility. ,"Chowning’s Tavern,Lord Botetourt,The King’s Arms Tavern","326 Francis St W Williamsburg, Virginia, 23185 United States",37.2685,-76.7045,mbisonrenkesslerdlc31723HenryCCalligirl78bblimpcaptainccrgyoungEdward Dennydlc31723ggavdapenaMMG04ccryowulfCCCalligirl78ccnwengerrrenkesslerPPrestonWFFacebook100000644533910HHenry,2008-11-21 00:00:00,"Lord Botetourt,Chowning’s Tavern,The King’s Arms Tavern,Virginia Musical Museum","Beechworth Asylum,Sanctuary Woods,Museum of the Central Hospital of Porto,Fergus Falls State Hospital ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eastern-state-hospital
877,Minerva's Shrine,"shrines,roman,rocks,religion,geology,sacred spaces",101,882,"It may look like a hobbit house, but this old, weathered rock was actually the site of ancient Roman worship. It’s where quarrymen came to honor Minerva, the Roman equivalent of the Greek Athena, goddess of war, art, wisdom, and craftsmen. It was probably out of respect for this latter attribute that laborers carved a shrine to her out of the natural rock nearly 2,000 years ago.The shrine sits in Edgar’s Field, now a quiet park on the banks of the River Dee but once a massive quarry where workers excavated and carried off the huge blocks of sandstone used to build Chester’s Roman wall. Here, before their shrine, quarrymen made offerings and prayed for success and safety in the course of their grueling, risky labor. Such shrines were not uncommon in the ancient world, but a combination of the intervening centuries and collectors have claimed nearly all of them—according to Historic England, it’s believed this is Western Europe’s only representation of a Roman goddess that’s still in its original location. As such, it’s the only shrine of its kind in the United Kingdom.The shrine is a bit the worse for wear. Weather and vandalism have worn off all the paint and nearly all the details which once adorned the figure of Minerva. A careful eye, though, can still discern her figure holding a spear and wearing a helmet, an owl over her shoulder on the right. The stone columns and awning over the shrine are a 19th-century addition, placed there in the hopes of warding off further damage. To the right of the shrine is a small barred opening known as Edgar’s Cave. It, like the park in which it sits, is named for King Edgar the Peaceable, who held a council in or near the field in the year 973. He is said to have received homage there from the lesser kings of the island. Later writers described a fanciful scene of Edgar being rowed up the Dee by eight princes; while that’s almost certainly an embellishment, it has remained a popular, romantic image associated with Chester. ",Western Europe's only representation of a Roman goddess still in its original location sits in an unassuming park. ,"Medieval Coffin of St John's,Chester Town Hall Clock Tower,Chester Rows","32 Handbridge Chester, England United Kingdom",53.1844,-2.8879,AZawackierjefferyGavinreley250growabeard1658,2018-01-26 00:00:00,"Medieval Coffin of St John's,Chester Rows,Chester Town Hall Clock Tower,The Cobweb Picture","Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag,Silla de Felipe II (Phillip II’s Chair),Roque Idafe (Idafe Rock),Église Notre-Dame de Vals (Church of Our Lady of Vals)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minervas-shrine

Its location between SoHo and the Lower East Side meant it was passed by other artists on a daily basis.However, that spot also made it prime advertising space, which is how it began to be used after being acquired by real estate developer Tony Goldman two years later. Luckily, Goldman was also an art aficionado, and in 2008 he handed over the wall to curator Jeffrey Deitch, who commissioned Gotham Scenic to recreate the Haring mural in honor of what would have been the artist’s 50th birthday. It only stayed up until that December, but the Haring tribute started a whole series for the Bowery Wall.The next year, Deitch commissioned a work from the Brazilian duo Os Gemeos, and in 2010 the wall was turned over to Shepard Fairey, with a casing placed over the slab to protect the previous piece. Unfortunately, the mural was targeted almost immediately by vandals, culminating in the casing being smashed through to reveal the Gemeos mural still painted underneath.Eventually Dietch moved to LA and passed on curation duties to The Hole, which began a regular rotation of artists with displays lasting four to six months, including Kenny Scharf, FAILE, Retna, Aiko, Crash, Maya Hayuk and Ron English.

Today, the barren walls, windows and doors rise mysteriously when the dam water levels fall.A museum dedicated to the lost city was built in nearby São João do Campo, and other commemoration efforts have taken place since the town was flooded 40 years ago.

A frontierswoman, alcoholic, Indian fighter, sometimes prostitute, she came to Castle to open a restaurant in the 1890s. This seems to have come to an abrupt end, since the local papers reported that “Mr. and Mrs. M. Burk, who started a restaurant here a few weeks ago, were arrested last Sunday morning” on charges of “absconding debtors”, all of which seems to somehow have been related to the couple not paying for a team of horses in their possession. They soon returned to their wandering lifestyle, eventually ending up back in Deadwood in the Black Hills. Like many other mine towns, the silver panic of 1893 caused the town to die a rapid death. It was finally abandoned by the last residents in the 1930s.Today once can still see the remains of the town, and the open rock basement is the remains of what was once the baker’s general store and post office. Berg’s meat market and Kidd’s furniture store was across the street and on the far hill side was Minnie’s sporting house.Castle is located on private lands, and permission is required for access.","Mining town from the late 1890s, once home to Calamity Jane. ","Bleu Horses,Canyon Ferry Lake's Cemetery Island,American Computer Museum","Meagher, Montana, 59053 United States 46.4413, -110.6719NearbyCanyon Ferry Lake's Cemetery Island41.63 milesBleu Horses54.54 milesAmerican Computer Museum57.08 miles",46.4413,-110.6719,hrossAnnetta Black,2010-04-06 00:00:00,"Canyon Ferry Lake's Cemetery Island,Bleu Horses,American Computer Museum,Madison Buffalo Jump State Park","Kiosk Ghost Town,Warm Springs Ghost Town,Volcano Historic Boomtown,The Ghost Town of Phoenix",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-town-ghost-town

At the time of the eruption, there was likely a small body of water at the site that filled with lava, creating unique features once the excess magma flowed away, leaving the bleak geology behind. One of the most impressive features is a naturally formed rock arch known as “The Church.”The name Dimmuborgir translates to “Dark Castles,” or “Dark Cities,” and the ominous name is a fitting monicker not only thanks to the eerie rock formations but also thanks to the creepy folklore associated with the site. Dimmuborgir has often been associated with hell, often as a gate to the nether realms. As Christianity came to the country the site was said to be where Satan landed when after being tossed out of Heaven. More traditional folklore says that the lava field is the home of the endlessly creepy Icelandic trolls known as The Yule Lads. These proto-Santa figures are mischievous trolls with names like Spoon-Licker and Window-Peeper.All of this stark geology and creepy mythology doesn’t just sound like a heavy metal dream, the site inspired the name of black metal legends, Dimmu Borgir.

Williams-Ellis incorporated architectural ruins and bits of salvaged buildings into his designs, including many disparate styles. Among other things Williams-Ellis called the village his “home for fallen buildings” and the extensive grounds are dotted with follies, sculptures, and ornamental ponds all part of his “light opera” approach to architecture.Portmeirion Village was made world famous when it was used as the setting for the wonderful 1960s British TV cult classic “The Prisoner,” and hosts a Prisoner weekend every year.

The grave was topped with a headstone that stated what little they knew about him. It reads, “UNKNOWN MAN DIED EATING LIBRARY PASTE JULY 14 1908.”Skeptics point to the fact that the grave’s red paint is very bright for being more than a century old.

However, this simple burial did not satiate his family, fans, or the rock and roll gods.After Hendrix’s death his father, Al, had his son buried in a section of Greenwood Cemetery set aside for the family. In life, Jimi had been a man of no great means and his burial site was a simple grave that seemed incongruous with the musician’s legacy. Nonetheless, the unremarkable headstone became a magnet for his legions of devoted fans passing through Renton.With the constant traffic and Al’s continued wish to create a memorial befitting his son’s remarkable life, it quickly became apparent that the small marker would not suffice permanently. However, it was not until Al finally regained the rights to his son’s musical catalogue in 1995, that plans began in earnest for an expansion of Hendrix’s monument. Over the next few years, the marble gazebo that can be found today was built and Jimi’s body was finally reburied beneath it in 2002.The memorial consists of a stone dome held up by a trio of pillars. Within the monument is an etched portrait of Hendrix alongside frescoes of some of his lyrics as well as the original headstone, which has been remounted.

The epic painting took over five years to complete using more than 600 gallons of paint and 400 youth volunteers working with historians, ethnologists, and anthropologistsSpearheaded by the group SPARC (Social and Public Art Resource Center), the work was a collaboration of at-risk youth and academic advisors.

Vanderbilt III left a lasting mark on the city.One of the most distinctive landmarks from this time is the Basilica of Saint Lawrence, located in the heart of the historic district downtown. It was designed in 1905 by the Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino, who came to Asheville to work on Vanderbilt’s Biltmore Estate.Guastavino fell in love with the area and decided to make the Blue Ridge Mountains home. He also decided that Asheville was in need of a grand Catholic church. With the help of the architect Richard Sharp Smith, who also worked on the Biltmore mansion, and funds raised by Catholics in the community, Guastavino built the architectural marvel that stands today. It is the only basilica in western North Carolina, topped with one of the largest freestanding elliptical domes in the United States.The Basilica of Saint Lawrence is constructed in Guastavino’s signature Spanish Renaissance Revival style, an ancient building method from Catalonia that the Spanish architect revived and brought to America. It uses masonry materials such as stone, brick, tile, and mortar exclusively—there are no wooden beams or steel in the entire church foundation. Elements of Guastavino’s distinct style can be found in many famous landmarks, including Carnegie Hall, Grant’s Tomb, Grand Central Terminal, the U.S. Supreme Court building, the Boston Public Library, and the American Museum of Natural History. With its unique exterior and massive dome spanning 58 feet by 82 feet, the Basilica of Saint Lawrence stands out from the surrounding buildings in downtown Asheville. But the interior is a hidden gem, teeming with religious art. Highlights include Italian-made statues, beautiful stained glass windows from Germany, and a frescoed high altar cut from Tennessee marble.The church was opened in 1909, a year after Guastavino’s death. It was finished by his son, and Guastavino senior is interred in a crypt inside the church. The door of the crypt is another architectural marvel. Guastavino, Jr. covered the door with luster-glazed art tiles that he experimentally developed in his garage.Nearly a century later, the significance of the work was given the ultimate recognition: It was dedicated as a basilica by the Pope in 1993.","This rare basilica nestled right in downtown Asheville is an architectural marvel, inside and out. ","Asheville Pinball Museum,Flat Iron Sculpture,Pritchard Park Drum Circle","97 Haywood Street Asheville, North Carolina United States",35.5974,-82.5563,zackofalltradesmpadweegreggkimbellPushingUpDaisies,2018-08-05 00:00:00,"Asheville Pinball Museum,Flat Iron Sculpture,Pritchard Park Drum Circle,Moogseum","Grote Kerk,Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús,Rotunda of Mosta,Culture House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/basilica-of-saint-lawrence-asheville
899,National Park Seminary,"schools,abandoned,architectural oddities,architecture",277,878,"Not far from the Capital Beltway is a cluster of formerly dilapidated structures, now integrated into a beautiful condo development. These are the remains of the National Park Seminary.The development dates back to 1887, when Ye Forest Inn was built as a tourist resort. In 1894, the buildings were turned into a girls’ boarding school called the National Park Seminary. The ornate, classically-inspired architecture on campus was based on plans brought from the Chicago World’s Fair. Girls lived in eight unusual sorority houses, one modeled on a pagoda, another on a Dutch windmill, another on a chalet. The seminary thrived the first decades of the 20th century as a finishing school for society girls, with 300 students including Hersheys, Chryslers, Krafts, and Maytags. By the Great Depression, only 40 students remained. During World War II, the Army took over the Forest Glen campus and used it for recovering amputees. It was also employed to house wounded soldiers during the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as for animal research. By the 1970s, the place was in a state of decay, and by 1978 all patients were gone. The Army planned to tear down the campus, but it was spared by the Save Our Seminary association. Arson destroyed one structure in 1993, and in 2003 a private developer took over the property and since then it has been reborn as a residential community, with the historic structures repurposed into houses and condos. As of summer 2018, only a handful of decaying buildings have yet to be restored, and they seem to be under construction. Because the buildings are private residences, it’s impossible to see the interiors of the restored buildings, including the famously splendid ballroom, outside of monthly guided tours led by the Save Our Seminary organization. There is also a self-guided tour, comprised of nine markers, that allows you to see building exteriors and learn about the history of the National Park Seminary.","A girls' boarding school inspired by the Chicago World's Fair, once abandoned, now restored to strange and scenic glory. ","Mammalian Brain Collection,National Museum of Health and Medicine,Washington, D.C.

The bottom of the steps has a small opening, so you can actually climb the stairs yourself.“Umschreibung” is a German word which means “euphemism,” or “circumlocution” and the Umschreibung web site states that the title translates to “‘circumscription’ or ‘periphrasis’ –  a movement without destination, a space defined by motion rather than walls.” It’s not easy to know exactly what Danish artist Olafur Eliasson had in mind when he created his towering sculpture in 2004.The sculpture is located in the middle of the courtyard of the KPMG building; in the midst of all that high-powered ambition and drive, perhaps it stands as a reminder that no matter how hard we work, we might all be going nowhere.

902,Predjama Castle ,"secret passages,tunnels,subterranean sites,architectural oddities,architecture",457,878,"Built directly into a rocky cliff face, Predjama Castle, or Predjamski grad in Slovenian, was considered virtually impenetrable when it was constructed in the 13th century. However, a few centuries later the structure’s fortifications were put to the test when a robber baron started a war with the Habsburgs and was forced to hole up in the castle for over a year.According to legend, Erazem Lueger and his family had taken over the Gothic Predjama castle in the late 15th century. Acquiring land and power, Erazem had become a well-known robber baron in the region. However, he quickly grew too big for his britches, murdering the kinsman of Frederick III, the Holy Roman Emperor. With the strength of all of his forces, Frederick came after Lueger, and forced him into hiding in his castle.Despite the Emperor’s superior forces, the rebellious Lueger had both brains and a secret tunnel between the castle and the nearby Postojna Cave. For an entire year and one day, Lueger snuck out of the castle and replenished food and drink through the tunnel from a nearby town. Finally, after surviving for so many days, one of his servants sold him out.Waiting for Lueger to use the outhouse on a high floor of the outside face of the castle, the servant raised a flag and one single shot from a cannon blasted the baron off the toilet.The castle has been completely reconstructed many times over the years. With a Renaissance-style remaining, the Gothic facade and the legend of Erazem Lueger are often forgotten. However, the Postojna Cave is still in use, allowing visitors to relive the siege and covert activities of a knight who crossed the wrong royal family of Europe. Another peculiar fact is that the cave under the Castle is the home to a colony of bats.","Castle and secret tunnel withstood a siege until its owner was killed by the Holy Roman Empire, while sitting on the toilet. ","Olm,Postojna Caves,Skocjan Caves","Predjama, 6230 Slovenia 45.8158, 14.1267Visit Website NearbyOlm4.35 milesPostojna Caves4.41 milesSkocjan Caves12.29 miles",45.8158,14.1267,DampoevanpeltCorinaIoanaepfromermackenzieprice13UrsulasskyewriterCorinaIoanaaallieseim1Luka EsenkojanwoTeaAndCoffeeLovernnld363eepfromerMichael BuschUrsulajetsettingfoolsmmackenzieprice13hrnickeevanpeltrrcollzMMartinAAllenatimian,2011-12-21 00:00:00,"Olm,Postojna Caves,Skocjan Caves,Soteska Pekel (Hell Gorge)","Congressional Garbage Tunnel,Milan's Hidden Bomb Shelters,Tower of Wind,Catacombs of Washington, D.C.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/predjama-castle

The facility was shuttered in 2009 and the buildings have since fallen into disrepair, which only adds to its haunting nature.With many deaths, murders, and suicides having occurred within the walls of this place it’s no surprise there are reports of its being frequented by spirits. The former prison is now open to visitors as a historic museum, and both regular and paranormal tours of the complex are offered. This was the fictional home of Ray McDeere in John Grisham’s book/film The Firm and was the destination of Dr. Hannibal Lecter before he escaped in The Silence of the Lambs.

That escape inspired The Barkley Marathons (the race that eats its young), which usually features the tunnel under the prison as part of the 20-plus mile loop on the 100 mile race.The main building resembles a medieval castle; the stone for the walls was mined by incarcerated workers from a quarry on the property.

905,Glenn Dale Hospital,"abandoned hospitals,abandoned,ruins",186,877,"In the early 1930s, at the height of the Great Depression, a tuberculosis epidemic swept through Washington, D.C. As hospitals in the city became overcrowded and overflow patients were sent to hospitals in neighboring Maryland and Virginia, it became clear that a dedicated facility was needed to handle the outbreak. That dedicated facility came in the form of the Glenn Dale Hospital, built in 1934 to meet the needs of tuberculosis patients, and to halt the spread of the disease.Although tuberculosis—also known as TB, and historically as “consumption” and the “white plague”—had been known by medical professionals since human antiquity, the question of how to treat it was largely based on guesswork. Moreover, due to its high rate of contagion, people diagnosed with TB were typically isolated or even shunned. Many were sent to live out the rest of their lives in rural sanatoriums. The patients’ families would frequently tell friends and neighbors that the infected relative had died, rather than admit to a tuberculosis diagnosis in the family.The preferred treatment for TB at the time consisted mainly of prolonged exposure to sunlight and fresh air. Thus, Glenn Dale Hospital was built as a sprawling 216-acre campus of 23 buildings separated by open, expansive lawns. Rooftop gardens were installed and tended by patients to further encourage them to spend as much time outside as possible. Underground tunnels (now flooded and decrepit) provided passage between building in inclement weather, but otherwise all transit and activities took place outdoors whenever the elements permitted.In the 1940s, doctors discovered that antibiotics proved much more successful in treating tuberculosis. As antibiotics became more widely available in the 1950s, the number of tuberculosis patients at Glenn Dale Hospital dwindled until, in 1960, it was repurposed as a nursing home and hospital for indigent patients. The facility was finally closed in 1982 due to high levels of asbestos in the buildings, as well as spiraling costs associated with structural upkeep. It has sat disused and moldering since then.Although police regularly patrol the grounds for trespassers, the ruins of Glenn Dale Hospital continue to attract graffiti artists, ghost hunters, local teenagers, and other curious explorers. It similarly attracts urban legends, with the most popular tales claiming that the site was once a prison or an insane asylum.There are vague plans to convert the grounds back to a nursing home at some point in the future, however the considerable asbestos remediation costs combined with the restrictive requirements associated with redeveloping the property have yet to attract a successful bid. So, for now, the hospital remains abandoned.",An FDR-era tuberculosis sanatorium has stood abandoned in the suburbs of the U.S. capital for over 30 years. ,"NASA Goddard Rocket Garden,Greenbelt Historic District,On the Brink","5201 Glenn Dale Road Glenn Dale, Maryland United States",38.9629,-76.8099,WhiskeyBristlesAprilWagner214Crystal HunkintheevolutionofwhalesLaflaneurekunkCCrystal HunkinAAprilWagner214ttheevolutionofwhalesLaflaneurekkunkRHyzer,2016-01-02 00:00:00,"NASA Goddard Rocket Garden,On the Brink,Greenbelt Historic District,National Capital Radio & Television Museum","Brestovac Sanatorium,Letchworth Village,Linda Vista Hospital,Sanatorio de Sierra Espuña",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glenn-dale-hospital
906,David Černý's Metalmorphosis ,"peculiar fountains,aletrail,inventions,outsider art",471,878,"Controversial Czech artist David Černý isn’t afraid of pissing people off. He jumpstarted his anti-government notoriety in 1991 by painting a Soviet tank in a Prague war memorial pink. The act scandalized Czech society.Not easily tamed, Černý followed up his insertion into the public consciousness with large-scale sculptures of, for example, two massive, naked backsides. Černý almost always encourages his viewers to interact with the art, and, in this piece, the observer can climb a ladder and stick his or her head inside the sculpture’s erm…back entrances. Another famous Černý sculpture is of two men urinating famous sayings from Prague residents into a small pond. Viewers can interact with this piece by texting their own messages for the figures to memorialize in a very special way.In comparison with his other works, Metalmorphosis, a mirrored sculpture housed in the Whitehall Technology Park in Charlotte, North Carolina, is tame and seemingly apolitical. The creation consists of nearly 40 steel pieces grouped into 7 segments which independently rotate 360 degrees. The mouth spits water into a surrounding pool. When the segments are aligned, the sculpture appears to be a giant, silver head with all of the usual fixtures in their regular places.When the motorized, internet-controlled segments are rotating, the result is an oddly mesmerizing perpetually moving showpiece which alternately looks like a human head—with disturbing, gaping holes where the mouth or eyes should be—or, alternately, like nothing replicated in the physical world. The reflecting pool beneath the sculpture creates an even more muddled reflection.Perhaps drawing on the quickly-shifting and revolving literary universe of fellow Czech artist, Franz Kafka, Černý notes the Metalmorphosis as something of a self-portrait of his own psyche. Maybe. Part of Černý’s rebellious artistic temperament includes creating a falsified biography of himself for the media. Whether or not it’s absolutely true, regarding the piece, Černý said,” This is how I feel; it is a mental self-portrait.”Appropriate for a technology park and perhaps a dig at the constant surveillance of modern times, you can watch the head rotate—all day, every day—on a webcam feed.Update as of January 2020: The Metalmorphosis is temporarily absent as it is currently undergoing routine maintenance. Update as of December 2020: Metalmorphosis is back.","A psychological self-portrait in the form of a giant, segmented head. ","James K.

907,Antelope Island on the Great Salt Lake,"wonders of salt,islands,animals",973,878,"Named for the species of Pronghorn Antelope that once lived here, Antelope Island is one of Utah’s Great Salt Lake’s 11 recognized islands. The Great Salt Lake in which it sits is the 4th largest terminal lake in the world, and is roughly 22 percent salt (with a specific gravity of 1.17), making it possible to float on the water with great ease. It is home to bison, antelope (which were re-introduced in the 90s), numerous migratory birds, coyotes, bobcats, eagles, and the ubiquitous brine shrimp and brine flies that live throughout the salt lake.However, the island and surrounding lake is home to some even more unusual characters as well. Antelope Island ( or possibly Freemont) was the location of exile for an odd criminal named Jean Baptiste. In 1862 the local grave digger was accused by Brigham Young and other members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints of stealing the clothes from up to 300 bodies. Young vowed to “make him a fugitive and a vagabond on the Earth,” and Baptiste was branded and sent to live on the island in exile. What Baptiste wanted with the clothes of the dead is still unclear. He later mysteriously disappeared from the island.There is another odd and somewhat less believable character associated with the lake known as the North Shore Monster. In 1877 Salt Works employees claimed to have seen a monster with a crocodile body and a horse head, though it is likely that what they saw was a bathing bison. A more recent and very real visitor to the salt lake was “Pink Floyd,” a Chilean flamingo escaped from a nearby aviary. The only flamingo in the entire lake, he migrated there for over 18 years, eating brine shrimp and socializing with gulls and swans.Also of interest is the yearly bison roundup, where the bison are herded into pens and checked for disease, inoculated, and extra calves are auctioned.Nearby on the northeastern shore of the lake is the giant Spiral Jetty sculpture of Robert Smithson.",The largest island on the great salt lake is home to curious creatures and strange stories. ,"Star Noodle Dragon,Eccles Dinosaur Park,SR-71C Blackbird","4528 West 1700 South Syracuse, Utah, 84075 United States",41.0892,-112.1157,DylanJaneelliot95slcjd82Kevin OKeeffeMama ShottsdustinkoMama ShottsJJaneelliot95JJudywBlindcolourWhiskeyBristlesddustinkosslcjd82rrenkesslerKevin OKeeffe,2009-02-13 00:00:00,"SR-71C Blackbird,Star Noodle Dragon,Eccles Dinosaur Park,Stump Spring","Nyamunini Island,International Fox Museum and Hall of Fame,Pelican Island,Rathlin West Lighthouse",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/antelope-island-great-salt-lake

Enoch Totten was a Civil War veteran and Washington lawyer. Mary Totten was extremely wealthy as her father was Timothy Howe, a senator of Wisconsin who was the cousin and heir of Elias Howe, known for perfecting the sewing machine.  Elias Howe also created the Bobbin-Winder, which inspired the namesake of the house.Originally, Winderbourne was painted pink complementing by dark rose trimming. The Tottens had a love for gardening, and staffed gardeners year round to maintain the exotic plants they imported from around the world.Many locals believe the house to be haunted, in part because of the immense tragedy that occurred there. All three of the Totten children contracted Typhoid fever, likely from drinking contaminated drinking water. One of the children died from this. Another daughter, Edith Totten, who became a doctor, adopted a daughter of her own who died after sliding down a long banister in the house and likely falling off. In 1929, the house saw a change of ownership to Edward and Beulah Pickrell. Their son, Edward Pickrell Jr., inherited the house and stayed there until his death in 2004. His brother Paxton Pickrell has been attempting to sell the long decaying property for years to no avail.The house is currently abandoned and has no plans of restoration.

There are rows of typewriters nailed to the wall, textbooks on the shelves, pencil sharpeners on display, and over a dozen globes hung from the ceiling. Dangling above the heads of the restaurant’s customers are those all-too-familiar multiplication and addition flashcards from our childhoods, perhaps adding a sigh of relief to the nostalgia. Public School 972 takes the grade school theme even further by naming Happy Hour as “recess,” updates on the restaurant as “class notes,” and making a reservation as a chance to “get educated” in the “art of food and beer.” But don’t worry: The food at Public School 972 is good, too.  It’s no school lunch.",A school-themed restaurant where gastronomy is the core curriculum.  ,"Texas Triffid Ranch,Russian Banya Family Spa and Café,The Grave of Bonnie Parker","14854 Montfort Dr Dallas, Texas United States",32.95,-96.8177,lewblankspringerRin Wolfe,2017-08-04 00:00:00,"Texas Triffid Ranch,Russian Banya Family Spa and Café,The Grave of Bonnie Parker,Collinsworth Cemetery","Sheroes' Hangout ,Nonnas of the World,Restaurante La Oruga,Tai Tung",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/public-school-972

Only the tombstones and mausoleums of the city’s rich, famous, and those with living families who paid to have markers moved were relocated. The rest of were sent to the rubble pile, eventually becoming building material in the growing city.The huge numbers of unclaimed tombstones ended up being used in breakwaters in the Marina District, as path liners at Buena Vista Park, and at Aquatic Park, where the distinctive stones can still be made out at low tide.  More recently, a cache of old stones was used to build the wonderful Wave Organ near the St. Francis Yacht Club.Today, only three cemeteries remain in the city of San Francisco—at Mission Dolores, the Presidio, and the lovely Richmond District Columbarium.",Gold Rush-era tombstones line the park's paths. ,"Jack's Record Cellar,The ""Center"" of San Francisco Monument,Dangling Legs at the Piedmont Boutique","Buena Vista & Haight Street San Francisco, California, 94117 United States",37.7688,-122.442,Annetta BlackSEANETTARacheladrienneleighmMaggie MasonhanaMMaggie MasonadrienneleighmSEANETTAJames RiccihanaRachel,2013-07-25 00:00:00,"Dangling Legs at the Piedmont Boutique,The ""Center"" of San Francisco Monument,Jack's Record Cellar,1908 Cistern Circles","Most Holy Trinity Cemetery,Tomb of the Mather Family,The Merry Cemetery,Lafayette Cemetery",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buena-vista-park-tombstones

Ninety-four sarcophagi and burial monuments range from the end of the 16th century to the beginning of the 20th, spanning four centuries of Brandenburg-Prussian burial culture.The Hohenzollern dynasty has its roots in the Holy Roman Empire; the house ruled the Duchy of Prussia as well as served as the Electors of Brandenburg. They parlayed this power into creating the Kingdom of Prussia and, subsequently, the German Empire. They ruled the Empire as Kaisers, benefiting from the realpolitik genius of Otto von Bismarck before destroying themselves in the bloody nightmare that was World War I.The current Berlin Cathedral was built in 1905, partly destroyed during World War II, and basically left in ruin till 1975, when it was finally decided to restore it. The Berlin Cathedral was rededicated in 1993. However, the small but significant funerary complex it sits on top of dates back to the late 16th century, and its restoration is still ongoing.The historic crypt includes a wide variety of artistic styles. From simple to very ornate, some of these final resting places are in better shape than others. Among the most notable sarcophagi are those of Frederick I and Sophie Charlotte, the first King and Queen of Prussia and the grandparents of Frederick the Great. The cathedral’s dome was bombed during World War II, and the resulting collapse and fire damaged and destroyed some of the crypt. An extra charge to tour the crypt goes towards the ongoing restoration and care for this collection.Be sure to view the surreal video explaining what happens to child Royals when they die.  It is mounted on a fence  at the start of one of the isles in the crypt. ",Beneath the impressive baroque cathedral that rises from the center of Berlin lies the largest collection of Prussian royals in the world.  ,"The DDR Museum,AquaDom at Radisson Collection Hotel, Berlin,Marx and Engels Forum","Am Lustgarten 9 Berlin, 10178 Germany",52.5192,13.4011,Lars of the JungleRHyzerkatielou106jackupandexplore1rootberlin,2016-06-29 00:00:00,"The DDR Museum,AquaDom at Radisson Collection Hotel, Berlin,Marx and Engels Forum,Pergamon Museum ","Cartuja de Miraflores,King's Chapel Crypt,St. Cataldus Catacombs,Hermitage of St. Albert Butrio",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hohenzollern-crypt-in-the-berlin-cathedral
913,Englewood Post Office,"postal,crime,crime and punishment",272,880,"The Englewood Post Office was built over a portion of the site once occupied by the famous “H.H. Holmes Murder Castle.”  The story as it is generally told, and made famous in Eric Larson’s book Devil in the White City, is that during the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition, Holmes built an intricate hotel on this spot for visitors to the world’s fair, killing and robbing many of them. The house was designed as a death trap, with gas lines he could control to asphyxiate people in their sleep (or not) and chutes he would use to dump his victims unseen into the basement, where he would dissect them, sometimes selling their bodies to medical schools, sometimes just disposing of the evidence. However according to Adam Selzer, a Holmes expert, the true story is a bit less salacious than that. When Holmes, a swindler, was arrested for insurance fraud in 1894, people remembered that he had a three-story building on 63rd Street that was known to be full of hidden rooms and secret passages. Then they realized that a handful of his employees had disappeared, and wondered if those passages could be for more than just hiding stolen furniture. Some of the missing people were found alive and well, but roughly half a dozen never were. He eventually confessed to 27 murders, though several of the people he confessed to killing were still alive at the time. Authorities thought the figure was closer to a dozen; pulp writers in the 20th century started crediting him with hundreds more. Most of the “castle” would have been in the space now occupied by the grassy knoll just east of the post office. Whatever the truth of the Holmes case, the post office that sits on the site of the castle today is unremarkable in every way. If you need to visit the post office for more mundane reasons it provides counter, money order, and P.O. Box services, but does not process passport applications or renewals.

The restaurant was taken apart, piece by piece, and stored in freighters to be replaced with a smaller, lighter restaurant. It seemed that it was the end of era for the famous eatery.It turns out that the restaurant would find a new home, not high above all of Paris, but on the streets of New Orleans. John Onorio and Daniel Bonnot, a famous French chef, got wind of the restaurant’s deconstruction, and paid 1.5 million dollars to ship the freighters containing the restaurant overseas to give the establishment a new start. Despite the rust that accumulated on the parts, and the freighters labeled in French, the restaurant was eventually rebuilt on St. Charles Avenue.The restaurant opened to a sold-out crowd on Thanksgiving day, 1986, and while chef Bonnot certainly cooked well enough to match the restaurant’s former glory, the new Restaurant de La Tour Eiffel would be short-lived. Three years after its grand reopening, the restaurant closed down due to financial pressure.The building, however, remained. A revolving door of would-be entrepreneurs would try opening subsequent restaurants and nightclub spots in the building, but nothing seemed to stick.

Eddie Walker started Stiltsville back in the 1920s or 1930s during the Age of Prohibition. The shacks - they were nothing more than that at the time - served as gambling and alcohol dens for individuals frustrated with state and national laws.

917,Gilroy Gardens,"horticulture,outsider architecture,plants",335,875,"Axel Erlandson never intended to create a new genre of shaping trees or become the father of an art movement. He just wanted to entertain his family.As young boy, the Swedish born Erlandson’s family settled in California. Axel grew up become a bean farmer, married his wife Leona in 1914 and had a daughter. That might have been the end of the story, had Erlandson not noticed the curious property of trees to naturally graft themselves together.Known as inosculation, it occurs when one tree bonds to another. This gave Erlandson an idea and he began creating plans for a series of trees that were purposely grafted together to create pleasing shapes. It wasn’t fast, taking many years to gently shape, graft and prune the trees, but it was satisfying and the odd trees amused his friends and family. His first creation was the “Four Legged Giant,” four trees which he grew combine into a single truck creating a kind tree-gazebo.In 1945, twenty years after Erlandson had begun his hobby,his wife and daughter mentioned seeing people paying to see such oddities as tilted buildings at the Mystery Spot. They returned home and mentioned (off hand) that Axel’s trees could draw people who would pay to see them if they were on a well-traveled tourist route. Erlandson loved the idea, moved his trees to a new location and sent some pictures of his unique trees to Robert Ripley. Ripley was impressed and rightly so; Erlandson had grown a tree that split into a cube, a tree that had two trunks forming an arch, and a tree (six, actually) that was woven like a basket, among others. No one had ever seen anything like it and Ripley featured it in his magazine 12 times. When asked how he did it, Erlandson refused to divulge his secrets and said simply “I talk to them.”Nonetheless, the tree circus was a not much of a financial success, and in 1963 Erlandson sold the property, trees and all, and died shortly thereafter. It wasn’t long before all 70 trees were forgotten and by 1977 only forty of the unique specimens remained. These were all scheduled to be bulldozed to create a mall.Luckily for the trees, and for the world, they were saved from this fate by Michael Bonfante, owner of Nob Hill Foods. Bonfante, a horticultural connoisseur, opened a theme park and in 1985 relocated the trees to what is now known as Gilroy Gardens.Today 25 of Axel Erlandson’s trees are on display at Gilroy, and Erlandson’s first creation, the Four Legged Giant remains alive and well at the park, some 80 years after it was begun.In the years since his death, Erlandson’s creations have inspired numerous other Tree shapers and in 2005 a Japanese expo was devoted to these horticultural creations of “Circus Trees”. With the increasing focus on sustainable living and green building, Erlandson’s tree structures may prove to be more relevant than anyone previously imagined.Remaining, but dead, examples of the Circus trees can also be seen at the Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and the Santa Cruz art museum.","Home to the ""Circus"" trees created by Axel Erlandson. ","Egg Vending Machine at Glaum Ranch,Grave of Bert Barrett’s Left Arm,SS Palo Alto","3050 Hecker Pass Rd Gilroy, California, 95020 United States",37.0106,-121.6279,DylanmbisonblackashFacebook100001174976100Findingbalance18,2009-08-08 00:00:00,"Egg Vending Machine at Glaum Ranch,Grave of Bert Barrett’s Left Arm,SS Palo Alto,The Center of Santa Clara Valley","Borderland State Park Mansion,Nature Friends Tourist Club,Auerworld Palace,Artigas Gardens",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gilroy-gardens-dt
918,Van Sant Crybaby Bridge,"ghost stories,ghosts,bridges,legends",264,874,"As the legend goes, many years ago a young woman got pregnant out of wedlock. Her family wanted nothing to do with her and her child. So upset was she by this that after giving birth, she crept out in the middle of the night with her baby in her arms and headed to the nearby bridge. Once there, she flung her baby into the water and then hung herself from the bridge’s rafters.This particular legend refers to the Van Sant Bridge in southeastern Pennsylvania, but different iterations of it are associated with several different so-called “Crybaby Bridges” across the United States. Whatever the particular details might be, the core elements of the myth remain the same: a child (or multiple children) met an untimely death at the bridge sometime in the past; the bridge is therefore now haunted, and the haunting manifests in the form of ghostly cries of the departed children that can still be heard to this day.In the case of the Van Sant Bridge, the story goes that if you park your car in the middle of the bridge you can hear not only the wail of the poor forlorn babe, but also the toes of the hanging woman scraping your car roof. One intrepid ghost hunter, however, surmises that the crying sound actually comes from red foxes that apparently inhabit the area.The bridge was built in 1875 and spans Pidcock Creek. It is also known as Beaver Dam Bridge. Apart from the unwed mother of the crybaby legend, the Van Sant Bridge is also reputed to have been a hanging place for horse thieves.",A historic covered bridge is but one example of an oddly prevalent American urban legend. ,"Boomer ,Bowman's Hill Tower,Green Sergeant's Covered Bridge","184 Covered Bridge Rd New Hope, Pennsylvania, 18938 United States",40.3279,-74.958,Jane Weinhardt Goldbergdlc31723MarcErickRHyzer,2016-07-14 00:00:00,"Bowman's Hill Tower,Boomer ,Green Sergeant's Covered Bridge,Doan Outlaw Graves","Draugarétt (Ghost Fold),Princess Theatre,Fye Bridge ,Old Applewhite Bridge",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/van-sant-crybaby-bridge
919,Byron Hot Springs Hotel,"hot springs,water,ruins",131,875,"The Byron Hot Springs Hotel has been a resort, a residence, an army interrogation center, and a monastery in its several-hundred year history.It has been burned down and sold, rebuilt and re-purposed. But now it only exists as a crumbling skeleton–a respite only for the cattle which share its land on the side of an otherwise sleepy city of Byron, California.Given its history of glamour, combustion, and military use, it makes a lot of sense to try to restore the Byron Hot Springs Hotel. But given the condition of the structure, it makes no sense. The three-story building is gutted, vandalized, cracked and outdated. If dreams to return it to its former grandeur should be realized, if groves and gardens and springs and popularity among the elite should be restored, it would only make sense to knock it down and start over.As it is, the prevalence of cowpies on the bottom floor suggests who gets the most use out of the place. Cattle are also likely the only living thing to see you, save maybe some construction workers before you enter the private property. Visitors can find parking off-site and walk to the entrance of the Hot Springs road. Palms partially obscure a spray-painted sign reading “Danger - No Trespassing,” and a bent barbed-wire fence is at the entrance to the trail. About a half mile down the road, the first sign that you’re going to have fun is a tree stump painted with the words “Turn Back.” Far down the road is the structure, in which there are of course rooms, bathrooms, closets and staircases, all with their own graffiti and photo ops. The elevator shaft is missing an elevator, and the lobby, lined with sweeping staircases on each side, is flush with broken concrete. Many of the palm trees  on one side of the hotel are severed near the base.No one has been keeping these littered, dumpy grounds for a long time, besides the cattle that graze nearby. Still, there is an unmistakable serenity to the place. The grass is green in the winter, and trees grow all around the property. Hills surround, topped with windmills.The property has changed hands and purposes more than Black Beauty. People and animals alike were attracted to the salt springs, and in 1863 the Risdon family filed for a land patent for 160 acres, with the hot springs on the center. Then it was bought by the Mead family, who made the place into a hotel in 1889, which only lasted until 1901 before burning down. A second hotel was built in 1901 and stayed up until 1912, when it was also destroyed by fire. The retreat attracted many wealthy people and celebrities for the “health benefits” of the hot, sulfurous waters that sprung from the ground. The third hotel was built in 1913 and closed in 1938 after lawsuits and the death of resort founder Lewis Mead.In 1941 the building became Camp Tracy, a WWII Interrogation camp for German and Japanese prisoners of war. This camp actually utilized cultural understanding, offered the prisoners access to the hot springs. Then it was sold to the Greek Orthodox church to be used as a Mission St. Paul, and then in 1956 it changed hands many more times. Different owners planned to restore the springs, but bankruptcy, politics, financial issues, illness, and more bankruptcy stifled all plans for development. Today, the property is owned by Stonecrest Investment Group, as part of the Coast Capital Income Fund, LLC. ",A ruined hotel with an unlucky history and an eerie present. ,"The Eye of Diablo,National Ignition Facility,Centennial Bulb","Old Byron Hot Springs Hotel Byron, California, 94514 United States",37.8483,-121.6333,Kristin Hugozanerussell07Martinsteve317317James Riccihrnicklliliazores90zzanerussell07PPaigiewagiessteve317317edventeerexxlelliotJames RiccihrnickssupernaturalsienaMMartinRachelMark Casey,2013-02-24 00:00:00,"National Ignition Facility,Centennial Bulb,The Eye of Diablo,Pixie Woods","Marobo Hot Springs,White Sulfur Springs Ruins,Deception Island,Karpur Baoli",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/byron-hot-springs-hotel

921,Lauriston Castle,"furniture,estates,castles,collections,museums,architecture",163,873,"Step inside the upper-class Edwardian world of Mr. and Mrs. William Robert Reid, the last private owners of Lauriston Castle who bequeathed their home to the nation in 1926 on the condition that their priceless collection is maintained. With 13th century origins as a medieval fortress belonging to the Napier family (to which the inventor of the logarithm, John Napier, belonged) Lauriston Castle is an extensively altered 16th-century manor house boasting idyllic grounds overlooking the Firth estuary. The house passed through several families over the centuries, ending with the Reids in 1903.Born into respectively successful Edinburgh families, William Reid and his wife were the final residents of Lauriston Castle. When they moved from 78 George Street in Edinburgh, they brought with them a number of the objects that still adorn the castle’s interior today—including pieces of British furniture, Chinese porcelain, Dutch ceramics, an extensive collection of Blue John objects, and mezzotint engravings. The transition prompted their foray into collecting European furniture, oriental rugs, and other coveted decorative items that were popular in the day. Highlights of the Lauriston Castle collection include a Scottish Lady’s writing desk constructed circa 1800, a late 18th-century French commode, William Reid’s exceptional collection of 18th-century Italian furniture, and a late 16th-century pietra dura tabletop boasting marble and magnificent semi-precious stones.William Reid was the owner of Morison & Company, one of the nation’s most respected fabrication businesses; while his wife’s brother, William Barton, helmed a sanitary engineering company that dealt with plumbing, electrical work, and hospital sterilization. The brothers-in-law worked side by side given their complementary trades, and together they installed much of the “modern” cabinetry and interior décor in Lauriston Castle—not to mention the building’s plumbing, lighting, and heating.In addition to the Reids’ notable collection of furniture and decorative objects, the museum exhibits a number of fascinating personal items from their daily lives like a newspaper clipping reporting the Titanic disaster, a telephone from the 1920s, Mr. Reid’s piano and sheet music, and Mrs. Reid’s walking stick. Like most historic Edinburgh homes, Lauriston Castle is said to be haunted.",This allegedly haunted 16th-century tower house-turned-museum exhibits thousands of spectacular objects. ,"Barnton Quarry Nuclear Bunker,Eagle Rock,Cramond Ghost Island","2A Cramond Rd S Edinburgh, Scotland United Kingdom",55.9712,-3.2785,Rachel GouldSEANETTAadamjasonmoorehrnick,2018-11-21 00:00:00,"Barnton Quarry Nuclear Bunker,Eagle Rock,Cramond Ghost Island,Sir Nils Olav","Castillo Mundo King,The Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings,Collectible and Antique Chair Gallery,African Heritage House ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lauriston-castle
922,Tenshou-Kyousha Shrine Mermaid Mummy,"feejee mermaids,cryptozoology,mummies",41,1032,"With an elaborate origin story that goes back centuries, the hideous mermaid at Fujinomiya may be the oldest of its kind.According to the story, the mermaid first appeared to Prince Shotoku at Lake Biwa. With its last breaths, it told a story of woe: the miserable creature had been a fisherman who trespassed to fish in protected waters, and was now transformed into a hideous beast as punishment. Having learned his lesson, and wanting to be an example after his death, the mermaid asked the prince to found a temple to display his horrible, mummified remains as a very strange object lesson in the sanctity of life.Notably different from Western ideas of beautiful mermaids luring sailors into the watery depths with their charms, the Japanese mermaid of lore, known as the “ningyo,” was often depicted as a pointy-toothed little monster, sometimes even sporting claws or horns. Despite this particular creature’s allegedly long history, it is difficult to overlook its similarities to the sideshow gaffs which became enormously popular after being first displayed by the infamous PT Barnum — gaffs which were known to often have been manufactured in Japan.Ancient or merely old, the mermaid is cared for by the Shinto order at Fujinomiya, near Mount Fuji.","Reportedly 1,400 years old, this may be the first of the Fiji Mermaids. ","Narusawa Hyoketsu (Ice Cave),Aokigahara Forest,Wind and Ice Caves","Fujinomiya Japan 35.2221, 138.6216NearbyAokigahara Forest16.72 milesWind and Ice Caves17.66 milesNarusawa Hyoketsu (Ice Cave)17.68 miles",35.2221,138.6216,Annetta BlackjanwojustinalanarnoldRachel,2013-05-20 00:00:00,"Aokigahara Forest,Wind and Ice Caves,Narusawa Hyoketsu (Ice Cave),Lake Yamanaka","Cryptozoology & Paranormal Museum,Ye Olde Curiosity Shop,International Cryptozoology Museum,Flatwoods Monster Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fujinomiya-mermaid-mummy
923,Bran Castle,"dracula,vampires,fortresses,castles,mountains,legends",766,872,"In the center of Romania is a medieval castle believed to have once held  Vlad Tepes Dracula, commonly known as “Vlad the Impaler” as a prisoner. The infamous Romanian ruler was immortalized as the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel, “Dracula,”.  The novel is believed to be inspired by the Romanian folklore lady serial killer Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Thanks to this loose link to the famous vampire, Bran Castle is popularly known in the region and beyond as “Dracula’s Castle.”Bran Castle was built between 1377 and 1388 atop a strategic site overlooking a heavily trafficked mountain pass between Transylvania and Wallachia, the land over which Vlad the Impaler ruled in the 15th century. Also known as Vlad III Dracula, the ruler is widely believed to be the inspiration for Count Dracula due to his historic bloodlust. He liked to torture people and would impale his enemies on the battlefield to deter his other enemies. During invasions, he was also known to use the scorched-earth policy, a military strategy that consists of destroying any possible resource that the enemy could use by poisoning water supplies and burning crops.Although the famous Wallachian ruler might have passed several times near Bran, there is no historical document attesting that he ever visited it. His visits to Transylvania were usually related to the boyars of Brașov. After his first reign, when he was sent into exile, he wanted to settle in Brașov, but John Hunyadi forbade them to provide him with shelter.The castle is owned by the descendants of Queen Marie, to whom it was given 1920 as a token of appreciation for her efforts to unify Romania. After her death, Bran Castle was inherited by her daughter, Princess Ileana, who ran it as a hospital during World War II. In 1948 the castle was seized by the Communist regime, but it was returned to Dominic von Habsburg, Princess Ileana’s son, in 2006.Currently, Bran is open as a museum, largely devoted to Queen Marie of Romania. The castle is also a popular location for Halloween events, like the 2016 competition to win the chance to stay in the castle Halloween night, retracing the steps of Jonathan Harker from the opening pages of Bram Stoker’s novel.Bram Stoker never visited central Europe, and there are other castles with more solid claims on Dracula’s legend, but underground passages and ancient weapons and armor, and not to mention all the creepy sounds the medieval building makes, make the Bran Castle an experience worthy of the vampire’s name. ","The possible imprisonment of Vlad the Impaler here earned the medieval castle its nickname, ""Dracula's Castle.""  ","The Mountain Sphinx ,Peleș Castle,Transylvania's ""Hollywood"" Signs",Strada General Traian Moșoiu 24 Bran Romania,45.5149,25.3672,Lizzy Mae van SonJR WetmoreTaterchipsovidiuneacsuErezSpeiserVioletaJR WetmoreTTaterchipsErezSpeiserVioletaovidiuneacsueepfromergingercinnamonDDariamotCCretuBogdan94mordekia,2017-08-01 00:00:00,"The Mountain Sphinx ,Peleș Castle,Transylvania's ""Hollywood"" Signs,Strada Sforii (Rope Street)","Castle of Roccascalegna,Corvin Castle,Ružica Grad,Béla Lugosi Bust at Vajdahunyad Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bran-castle

Having reached its peak cultural saturation in the 1970s, people tend to either really love or hate the things. Los Angeles’ Velveteria is delighted to be of assistance – although they’re highly biased.As early as the 13th century, Marco Polo reported seeing painted velvet portraits of Hindu deities in India, with religious images continuing to appear on velvet canvases throughout the Middle Ages. Transcending time and modernity throughout 14th-century Kashmir, 16th-century China, and 19th-century England, black velvet paintings finally attained full-on cult status in the 20th century. By that point, Jesus appeared just as frequently as matadors, unicorns, hula girls, and, of course, that other King — Elvis.Enter: Caren Anderson and Carl Baldwin, founders and curators of the Velveteria. An oddball museum if there ever was one, the Velveteria keeps the black velvet craze of the mid-1970s alive and well with plenty of retro kitsch—but also a surprising number of new commissions and modern takes on this practice. As lifelong enthusiasts, the pair has amassed a collection surpassing 3,000 of these paintings.In 2005, the museum’s first iteration opened its doors in Portland, Oregon where it enjoyed years of endearing weirdness before closing up shop and relocating southward to warmer and sunnier climes. The present collection can now be found in the heart of Los Angeles’ Chinatown, where more than 400 of the finest specimens from the couple’s treasure trove are on display, six days each week. Though each visit feels a bit like a trip down a rabbit hole in its own right, the most otherworldly element of all is the museum’s black-light room, where the ghoulish and trippy velvet paintings really seem to come to life.Update as of October 2019: The museum is in transition and is currently closed. Update as of November 2019: The former location is now closed and the museum is looking for a new home. ",The art and history of the velvet painting are on full display in this Los Angeles museum. ,"Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,Cakeland.LA,'América Tropical'","711 New High Street Los Angeles, California United States",34.0604,-118.2387,littlebrumblechrstyttechnoblogicalknoxiumjondi letnaptylskiettechnoblogicalchrstytjondi letnapknoxiumtylskieAvoiding Regret,2016-03-27 00:00:00,"'América Tropical',Cakeland.LA,Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,Triforium","Museo Dolores Olmedo,Rafael Coronel Museum,The American Visionary Art Museum,Museo del Barro (Museum of Clay)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/velveteria

The cottage was dismantled and rebuilt in 1869 to make room for Linderhof.Though much smaller, the architecture of the magnificent palace is extravagant with ivory candelabras and a carpet made of ostrich down. Inspired by Versailles, Ludwig created a mirror image of “Sun King” Louis XIV’s bedchamber and styled himself the “Night King.” Like his Neuschwanstein Castle, Linderhof was also deeply inspired by composer Richard Wagner. Many rooms sport the themes of some of Wagner’s greatest works.Amidst the forested mountainous terrain, Ludwig built huge ornamental gardens that borrowed styles from a number of other countries and eras. Perhaps the most extravagant is the “Venus Grotto” a man-made cave lake with a waterfall. Ludwig enjoyed rowing across it in a golden shell-shaped boat.

927,Library of Congress Card Catalog,"government,technology,libraries,books,collections,museums and collections,history",506,873,"For decades, an elegant card catalog occupied a central spot in the Library of Congress Main Reading Room. Before computerization, it was as central to the research process as a search engine in the present day.When the Main Reading Room was closed for renovation in 1987 the Library returned the room to its original form with desks in a full circle. This meant moving the card catalog to desks adjacent to the Main Reading Room on the first floor of the Jefferson Building. No cards have been added since 1980, but the catalog is still used by researchers and librarians.The Library of Congress card catalog system dates back to 1898. By 1901 the LC Card Division was producing vast quantities of them for sale to libraries across the country. Every book in the collection had a standardized card listing, relevant metadata, and cross-referenced topics. There’s something undeniably interesting about perusing the rows of cards, taking in the subtle variations in typography and handwriting on each one. The cards are pleasantly tactile, and the paper has the faint smell of old book. It’s the same physical power that keep some book lovers from ever making the switch from hardcover to ebook, convenience be damned. The Main Reading Room is open to the public twice a year for an open house. Adult visitors often venture in to the catalog area and breathe in deeply as they remember the smell of the library they grew up with.Romance aside, digitization of the card catalog made a lot of sense. “But to some people, it’s an icon,” LC Director of Planning Bob Zich told the Washington Post in 1984. “It’s like a religion.”Modernization proceeded under the direction of Henriette D. Avram, a former NSA programmer and pioneering female computer scientist. The project began in 1967, but was not complete until the mid-1980s because of the vastness of the Library of Congress collection.  The catalog was first brought onto the World Wide Web in 1993, making the collection far more accessible to the American public. Today it is queried millions of times per day. Bizarre side note: The online catalog website actually had operating hours when it was first launched and “closed” at 5 p.m. Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Margot Williams warned her readers in 1994 “don’t try this [accessing the website] at midnight.”A different card catalog, used by  primarily by catalogers, is stored in the basement of the Library of Congress Madison building, and is not open to the public.",A nostalgic bibliographic gem. ,"Reading Room at the Folger Shakespeare Library,Library of Congress Book Conveyor Tunnel,Bootlegging Room in the Cannon House Office Building","101 Independence Ave SE Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.8867,-77.0042,Elliot Cartermarla m wwlorie shaull,2017-02-17 00:00:00,"Library of Congress Book Conveyor Tunnel,Bootlegging Room in the Cannon House Office Building,Reading Room at the Folger Shakespeare Library,Capitol Bollards","U.S. Naval Observatory Library,Palace Green Library,Louwman Historic Telescopes,Bibliotheca Thysiana",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/library-of-congress-card-catalog

In response to an order to “pick the trucks up,” he elevated the aging vehicles by burying one end in the ground, attached to a heavy concrete base. This tipped the remainder of the vehicle up into the air, and Truckhenge was born. The outspoken Lessman painted slogans across the rusting automobile such as “Rise Up” and “Freedum Isn’t Lost,” making them even more idiosyncratic than before.While the distinctly American henge was initially considered an eyesore, it was eventually designated as a piece of art. In addition to the truck installations, Lessman’s farm is sprinkled with other homemade artworks, most notably a number of found item constructions known as “Beer Bottle City.”Visitors are more than welcome to visit Lessman’s farm so long as they contact Lessman first and arrange to meet up with him.

The collection was established at the behest of a textile merchant named Humphrey Chetham who expressly stipulated that the library “require nothing of any man that cometh” and be “for the use of schollars and others well affected.” Simply stated, he wanted his posthumous library to be public and academic. The merchant them named dozens of ruling agents who he tasked with collecting a collection of texts and writings to rival any of England’s libraries, and the Chetham’s catalogue began. The library has continually been in use since its inception with scholars and researchers from a number of disciplines searching the stacks for info.

The head of the Neapolitan Masonic lodge, Raimondo di Sangro was a true Renaissance man, an ardent disciple of the sciences, practitioner of alchemy, a mystic, inventor, and polyglot.The prince spoke numerous languages including Arabic and Hebrew, and invented, among other wonders, a hydraulic device, an “eternal flame” using chemical compounds of his own invention, and a carriage with wooden horses which, apparently, could travel on both land and water.To the townsfolk, this all seemed a bit…dark wizardish. A “black legend” arose about the prince and local rumors flew that the prince could create blood out of nothing, that he was a Rosicrucian (as a Mason, he was close enough), and that he had people killed to carry out his dark experiments. (It only added to his dark reputation that a grisly murder, with which the prince had nothing to do, took place in his family home.)Ignoring the speculation on his evil ways, the prince went about his business collecting an interesting set of artistic and scientific objects. Among these were two “anatomical machines” showing a man and a pregnant woman. (There was once an anatomical fetus displayed as well, but it was stolen from the museum.) Built on real human skeletons, these fleshless bodies represent the veins, arteries, and musculature in amazing detail. Long thought to be made by an early form of plastination, they were recently discovered to be made—with the exception of the human skeletons—of beeswax, iron wire, and silk.The anatomical “Adam and Eve” were made by anatomist Giuseppe Salerno and were meant to illustrate the viscera and arterial systems of human beings. But they also furthered the “black legend” around the prince, and many believed that the prince had two of his servants killed to use their bodies in the construction of the models.Other interesting objects in the Crypt include the sculptures “Veiled Truth” and the “Veiled Christ.” The “Veiled Christ” is a particularly bizarre looking sculpture, made from marble, which distinctly resembles Han Solo encased in Carbonite. The Veiled Christ inspired a number of its own “black legends” including that the Prince had invented a process for the “marblization” of real human bodies.Between the family crypt covered in masonic symbols, the anatomical machines, and the unnerving “veiled” sculptures, it is not difficult to understand why the Prince was surrounded by a “black legend.” Then again, this may have been just how the mysterious alchemist Prince wanted it.","These ""anatomical machines"" are only one of the many strange items in this Italian crypt. ","The Arm of St. Thomas Aquinas,Tomb of the First Bishop of New York,Sacristy of San Domenico Maggiore","Via Francesco De Sanctis, 19/21 Cappella Sansevero Naples, 80134",40.8492,14.2548,DylanmbisonMartinOsageCorpse AltarRachelOsageMMartinCorpse AltarRachelmmbisonAnnetta Black,2012-06-26 00:00:00,"Sacristy of San Domenico Maggiore,Tomb of the First Bishop of New York,The Arm of St. Thomas Aquinas,Santa Maria delle Anime del Purgatorio ad Arco","Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte,Dargavs Village,Jules Verne's Tomb,De Brazza's Mausoleum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-anatomical-machines-of-cappella-sansevero-naples-italy

933,Paternoster Lift,"elevators,preservation,architectural oddities,history,architecture",440,1031,"An elevator with no door that doesn’t stop or slow down sounds like a sci-fi nightmare, but lifts like these were once common in many parts of Europe. The paternoster lifts are today a dying breed after safety norms banned their construction.These once-ingenious creations were invented in the 1860s by Peter Ellis, an architect from Liverpool, England. They were the world’s only “continuously moving” elevators. Popularly used in government buildings and stores in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe, they captured the imagination of many, including writers and filmmakers who featured the contraption in their work.Despite urban myths that spread about its functioning, the mechanism is quite simple. Users hop into the many open compartments of a paternoster, which travel in a loop, and hop off when it glides by their destination. Once a compartment has reached the bottom floor, it continues further, eventually rotating along an axis and starting to move in an upward direction. The opposite happens when the elevator has reached the top floor. Its movement resembles the way rosary beads are counted in a pious person’s hands, and this is where it is thought to get its name: Paternoster is Latin for “our father,” the first two words of the Lord’s Prayer.The production of paternoster lifts came to a halt in the 1970s due to safety concerns. There are currently 68 of these models in Czechia, about half of which are located in Prague. In spite of their potential harzards, people tend to view them with a sense of nostalgia, and as such, they have become the object of protection and restoration projects.  The most accessible and arguably the best maintained paternoster lift in Prague is located at the back of Prague City Hall, which is in and of itself a splendid example of Art Nouveau architecture. This model consists of 12 compartments and was designed by John Prokopec in the early 20th century.Update September 2018: The lift is open again to the public.

934,Scala Contarini del Bovolo,"renaissance,stairs,palaces,architecture",671,871,"Hidden in the center of Venice, unknown to most tourists, is a spiraling “snail” staircase that winds up the tower-like facade of a historic palazzo. It was so unique at the time it was built at the very end of the 15th century that it’s responsible for naming both the palace it’s attached to and the entire branch of the Contarini noble family that lived there.Secluded in the middle of the sestiere of San Marco, the palazzo’s crowning feature is the large interior flight of winding stairs that spirals up into the sky, named the Scala Contarini del Bovolo. “Del Bovolo” translates to “of the snail” in the Venetian dialect, referring to the spiral shape of the scala (staircase).The winding tower was so popular, the “bovolo” name became forever attached to not only the palace but also the Contarini family, one of the founding families of Venice, who had the spiraling facade built to showcase their great wealth.Though it’s not far from the Campo Manin, the staircase can be quite difficult to find. It’s located on a small backstreet that requires navigating Venice’s notorious maze of narrow alleyways. It is worth the effort. The scala with its attached arcades spirals 90 feet high, combining elements of Gothic, Renaissance, and Byzantine styles. Visitors can climb to the top of its 80 steps, from which there is a beautiful view over the rooftops of the city. The architectural gem is depicted in Jacopo de Barbari’s famous bird’s eye view of Venice, painted in 1500 (now held at the Museo Correr). The storybook staircase also made a prominent appearance in Orson Welles’ 1952 adaptation of Shakespeare’s Othello.","This palatial spiral staircase was so unusual the name ""snail"" was given to the noble family who built it.  ","St. Mark's Clock Tower (Torre dell'Orologio),Monument to Niccolò Tommaseo,St. Mark's Lost Third Column","Corte Contarina, del Bovolo, 4303 Venice, 30124 Italy",45.4348,12.3346,matthiasheinrichJLP60615reley250tylercolejustjoshyerjefferyjjustjoshycguthrie1950Luka EsenkoyellingBytesreley250erjefferyJJLP60615Braecresttylercole,2018-02-15 00:00:00,"St. Mark's Clock Tower (Torre dell'Orologio),Monument to Niccolò Tommaseo,St. Mark's Lost Third Column,Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs","Tulip Stairs,Frederiksborg Castle,Palais de l’Île ,Palau Güell",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/scala-contarini-del-bovolo

Located in the city’s Gothic quarter, four 2,000-year-old columns from the Roman Empire’s Imperial Period are guarded by the building that houses the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya (Hiking Club of Catalonia).The temple was built to honor Emperor Augustus and once towered over the ancient Roman city of Barcino. It was constructed of sandstone from nearby Montjuïc Hill and at least partially plastered over. The 120-foot-long building was built in the first century. It was surrounded by numerous 30-foot-tall columns, but now only four remain.Most of the stones from the temple were reused for other buildings. Three of the columns remained intact, forming part of the inside of a new structure. They were found in the 15th century, but no one could figure out their origin until the 19th century, when it was discovered they were in fact the remains of a Roman temple.The fourth column was rebuilt from the remains of the other columns and erected in the Plaça del Rei (King’s Square) in 1879, where it stayed until 1956 when it was moved to the spot where it stands now, next to the original three columns, which have never been moved.

The clear waters of Þingvallavatn Lake in the Þingvellir National Park attract divers from around the globe to experience the unique feeling of diving between worlds, where visibility is often as good as 300 feet between lava-rock cliffs. Even the waters in Silfra are unique. Since no rivers flow into Þingvallavatn Lake the water actually gets slowly extruded through the porous tectonic rock beneath the water’s surface. This process filters the water and not only accounts for the lake’s incredible clarity but also makes the lake mostly safe to drink. Pushing water through stone is not very quick no matter how porous the rock, so it takes between 50-100 years for the liquid to become part of the lake. Each drop of water in Silfra is likely over a century old.    Photos of Silfra abound and even amateur divers and photographers find that their experience between the plates is like nothing else on Earth or in its waters.",This natural Icelandic fissure allows divers to swim right between two volatile tectonic plates. ,"Þingvellir Church,Kerid Crater Lake,Þingvellir",Silfra Thingvellir Iceland,64.2564,-21.1181,Annetta Blackssheppard3Jaszmina SzendreySpiffyDr Alan P NewmandacubsruleSSpiffyaaribrownsssheppard3Dr Alan P NewmanddacubsruleRachelJaszmina Szendrey,2014-02-04 00:00:00,"Þingvellir Church,Þingvellir,Kerid Crater Lake,Reykjadalur","Keahole Point Blowhole,Jigokudani (Hell Valley),Laguna Quilotoa,Kerid Crater Lake",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/silfra

In the 1930s, the area was still productive farmlands, but poor farming practices resulted in the creation of the rolling martian landscape.As dirt and vegetation were worn away by the elements, the Queenston shale below the surface farmland was exposed. Unfortunately, the shale supports little or no vegetation, and has left the area as barren badlands. The reddish hue of the Badlands is caused by iron oxide, while narrow greenish bands show where groundwater has transformed the rock from red to green iron oxide.Care should be taken while visiting, as this area is very fragile. Visitors should not climb on the hills after a rainfall or when the ground appears soft. Violation of this unwritten rule will also result in a nasty reddish dirt stain that most travelers work to avoid while on vacation.As of August 2019, you can visit most of the Cheltenham Badlands in Ontario, however, check their website beforehand, as conservation projects are ongoing.

938,Szimpla Kert,"bars,Unique Restaurants & Bars,abandoned",751,871,"Walking into Szimpla Kert in Budapest’s District VII is a bit like stumbling into the world’s most interesting junkyard. The former factory has multiple levels and a maze of different rooms, each its own curiosity shop. Now a pub, its decor is a hodgepodge of items, including a kangaroo statue, a Trabant car (in which you can sit and drink), and a bathtub cut open on one side to serve as a couch. There’s graffiti on the walls, and the exposed brick conceals nothing of the building’s structural core. Disco balls hang overhead, as do upturned chairs, and plants sprout up in its large, open-air garden. There’s a method to this madness, which is to elevate items that might be considered junk to the stature of high design.Szimpla Kert, Budapest’s first “ruin bar,” opened in an abandoned factory in 2002, a far cry from elegantly outfitted trendy watering holes. Ruin bars have since become some of the coolest spots in the Hungarian city, seen as successful endeavors at repurposing decaying urban structures into lively communal spaces. But some of these buildings have tragic histories that cannot be overlooked, especially in District VII (also known as Erzsébetváros), which was previously Budapest’s Jewish quarter. Szimpla Kert’s space in particular was once a brick and furnace (some sources say fireplace) factory. By some accounts, the Jewish factory owners were deported during World War II, and the building went through several iterations, becoming a furniture factory and a multi-family residence, before it was vacated completely.As part of an effort to revitalize the neighborhood, Szimpla Kert now hosts regular community events, including a weekly farmer’s market, a flea market, and fundraising programs. It is, however, most well-known for its decor and its entertainment. There are film screenings, theater shows, a “self-awareness disco,” and even a recording studio tucked somewhere in the maze. During the day, the pub is open for food, coffee, live music, and pop-up exhibits. By night, the psychedelic lights turn on and indie bands take the stage. One curious bar offering: a jar of peeled, raw carrots, which are actually quite popular. Carrots or not, both visitors and locals flock to Szimpla Kert for its carefully curated decor, food, drinks, and music.","A Trabant car, a kangaroo statue, and a plethora of plants take over this abandoned-factory-turned-bar. ","Righteous Among the Nations Memorial,Elektrotechnikai Múzeum,Ghetto Wall Memorial","14 Kazinczy u.

Today, the town is home to a museum and a statue dedicated to him.The unique, yellow and red stone and terracotta building was designed by Barnum himself as an institute for science and history. It wasn’t until years later that it became a museum dedicated to him. Among some of the wonders of this three-story museum are a preserved elephant, a facsimile of his original Fiji mermaid, a 1,000-square-foot miniature circus, and an authentic, unwrapped mummy named Pa-Ib.Barnum’s statue is located just down the road a bit from the museum in Seaside Park, which overlooks Long Island Sound.

942,The Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow,"memento mori,intriguing environs,catacombs and crypts,cemeteries,ecosystems,churches,sacred spaces",670,869,"The oldest existing church in New York, the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow (also known as the Dutch Reformed Church) and its two-and-a-half-acre colonial-era burying ground served as the inspiration for Washington Irving’s short story “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.”Published in 1820, Washington Irving’s “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” is the first story written by an American to achieve universal acclaim. It is widely read and the subject of over a half dozen major films.  It tells the story of Ichabod Crane, a superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut who competes with Abraham Van Brunt, a local Dutch-American, known as “Brom Bones” for the hand of Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of a “substantial Dutch farmer.” Following an autumn “frolic” at the Van Tassels’, Schoolmaster Crane mysteriously disappears. Many claimed Ichabod was driven off by the galloping headless ghost of a Hessian trooper who got decapitated by a cannonball during the American Revolutionary War. Brom, however, looked “exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related.” Thus, Irving leaves the reader wondering if the goblin chased off the schoolmaster, or could it have been Van Brunt?Founded in 1685, the church is among the oldest in the United States and still has an active congregation. Construction began around 1682 by Frederick Philipse, lord of a huge manor in the lower Hudson Valley. His lordship built with the church two-foot-thick walls composed of local fieldstone. A carpenter by trade, he built the pulpit himself and lies buried with thirteen family members under the church floorboards.  The Friends of the Old Dutch Church and Burying Ground, a nonprofit, all-volunteer organization, maintains and preserves the site. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Today, the church is owned by the Reformed Church of the Tarrytowns and still used for summer services and on Easter and Christmas Eve.Among the notables buried on in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery adjacent to the church’s grounds are Andrew Carnegie, Walter Chrysler, Samuel Gompers, Elizabeth Arden, Leona Helmsley, Brooke Astor, and William Rockefeller. The cemetery also holds the remains of local people who inspired Washington Irving’s “Sleepy Hollow” characters.  Every autumn, tens of thousands of visitors flock to the Old Dutch Church and the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery for seasonal events that draw on the legend.","Oldest existing church in New York and the inspiration for Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."" ","Headless Horseman Bridge,Chagall and Matisse Glass,Kykuit, the Rockefeller Estate","420 N.

Known as Boon Island, this rocky outcropping is home to New England’s tallest lighthouse, Boon Island Light, which stands 133 foot tall and makes the tiny shoal identifiable for miles. Before the light was built in 1855, however, Boon Island was notoriously dangerous for ships. Most famously, the British merchant vessel, Nottingham Galley, wrecked on the island in December 1710. Of the Nottingham Galley’s 14 crew members, two died due to injuries sustained in the wreck, and two died aboard a makeshift raft in a desperate attempt to reach shore. The remaining ten sailors, who could see the mainland clearly, though they could not signal for rescue, stayed alive for 24 days without shelter, food, or fire. Only by eating the remains of their dead compatriots were they able to survive. After the ten were rescued, their story of cannibalism and survival on the island made it infamous.After many years of light keepers on the island, today, Boon Island is uninhabited and the light is operated by solar power. When visiting by boat, despite the massive tower of the light looming over you, it is still easy to imagine how desperate and alone the Nottingham Galley crew must have felt. The rocks are barren and unfriendly looking, while shore seems just out of reach.It’s well worth a day trip to see one of New England’s most notorious shipwreck sites, and to make you grateful that you can return to shore.

For most of its life it was simply a utilitarian lot with a brick Art Deco municipal building to house the machinery (which is now an exhibition space) tucked into a quiet neighborhood of modest and colorful old homes. When the substation was overhauled to accommodate the current grid, the new machines were installed outside and quickly became an eyesore. In 2008, the City of Austin organization Art in Public Spaces, commissioned local artist Berthold Haas to construct a whimsical wall to obscure the new substation and make the park a serene, inviting, and almost fairytale place.With help from neighbors (who have left their names if you look closely), an assemblage of karst stones, aggregates, mirror balls, slag glass, broken antique glass dishes, ammonites and other shells, painted stucco, petrified wood, molded cement frieze, marbles, repurposed ceramic disk insulators, and more old substation hardware was built. It shows clear influence from Antonio Gaudi’s Parq Guell (and perhaps other Spanish Art Nouveau creations), 60’s psychedelia, the Wonder Cabinets of 1700’s Germany, the early 20th century Midwestern Grotto Culture, and the more conventional grottos seen in stately English gardens. Many of the materials used are local and impart a sense of place to the serpentine creation, shaded under large old Cedar Elms. Also on the site is a circular promenade with Crape Myrtles, Mexican Plum trees, Yaupon Holly, and a trellis tunnel with Trumpet Vine and Wisteria. Though tired looking in the 105-plus degree heat of mid-summer (mid-June to mid-September), it is lush and a perfect place for a sack lunch during the spring and fall monsoons.This is a perfect place for children to explore and touch, and for the elderly or those with physical limitations to enjoy something stimulatingly offbeat without having to trundle up some dusty, thorny hillside.

It is said that Herodias, wife of King Herod Antipas, played a role in John the Baptist’s execution. She also feared that if his body and his head were buried together he might come back to life, and prompted her daughter to ask the king for the prophet’s head on a platter. Though most agree that John’s disciples brought his body to the village of Sebastia, accounts of what happened to his head differ greatly.Some say that Herodias had the head buried in the fortress where John was beheaded, while others claim she hid it within Herod’s palace at Jerusalem. There are accounts that it was discovered during the reign of Constantine, or that it was found during the Crusades and brought back to Europe. Islamic tradition maintains that the head is in Damascus, interred in a building that was once the Basilica of St. John the Baptist and is now the Umayyad Mosque. Churches in Germany and Jerusalem also claim to have fragments of the skull.According to Roman Catholic tradition, San Silvestro in Capite (Basilica of St. Sylvester the First) in Rome is home to the true relic, which can be viewed in the first chapel to the left of the entrance. It is not a full skull, just the top part of one, which has been set into a wax skull.

The museum displays around 6,000 pieces from his some 20,000. Displayed in cacophonous frames the stickers are the type one might see on a street lamp, skate deck, or mailbox in any big city. Staying away from children’s stickers entirely, most of the pieces are designed in the much talked about pop art style that many street artists traffic in currently. Skateboard logos and band designs jockey for space next to hand illustrated name tags and postal labels. All types of stickers are welcome and donations are encouraged.In addition to Baudach’s permanent collection, an adjoining space also features a rotating roster of exhibition shows focusing on a single artist or style.

But the city’s original theatre district was in the Tenderloin area which is now known as Herald Square. And since 1885, actors, audience members, and theatre impresarios would seek refreshment at Albert Keen’s chophouse. Legend has it that actors in full costume from the Garrick theatre next door would rush into Keen’s between acts for a quick ale and a bite of his famous mutton chops before running back on stage.But what makes Keen’s quite so extraordinary is what hangs from the ceiling: the world’s largest collection of Church Warden pipes. Being made of clay and too fragile to carry around, smoking enthusiasts would keep their pipes at the tavern for their own private use when dropping in. And Keen’s has over 90,000 pipe smokers on its roster, amongst them such tobacco smoking luminaries as Theodore Roosevelt, Buffalo Bill Cody, Herbert Hoover, Albert Einstein, and Babe Ruth. Each pipe is numbered, and upon entering the Chophouse, you would hand your membership over to a page boy who would retrieve your pipe. City laws today have brought an end to this civilized past time, but the 90,000 pipes still adorn the ceilings of the dining rooms of Keen’s Chophouse. As you walk through the rabbit warren of rooms (the Lincoln Room, the Lambs Room, the Lillie Langtry Room) and end up at the wood paneled bar, over which hangs the seductive portrait of Miss Keen, the proprietor’s mistress, it is easy to imagine stepping back in time, to when this corner of New York was the heart of its theatrical community.Today’s visitors can enjoy themselves in this hidden New York gem with Keen’s own pub ale and their famous mutton chops. “A mutton chop at Keens!” ran an old advert, “There’s a reminder to thrill a man who has been around!

952,Overseas Railroad and Pigeon Key,"follies and grottoes,ghost towns,islands,ruins",801,868,"Pigeon Key has been abandoned twice: first when a devastating hurricane on Labor Day 1935 killed the vast majority of its inhabitants, and again in 1982 when a new Seven Mile Bridge was opened, passing a few hundred meters away from the isle which had previously served as a rest stop between Miami and Key West.At the turn of the 19th to 20th centuries, Florida tycoon Henry Flagler had a vision to build a railroad extension running from Homestead,a town in the southernmost tip of mainland Florida, along the Keys to its final destination in Key West. It was to be called the Key West Extension, or the Overseas Railroad. Ever the entrepreneur, Flagler sought to corner the trade market via Key West, as it was the closest deep sea port to the new Panama Canal and trade with Cuba was booming at the time.When Flagler started building the rail extension in 1905, most observers saw it as an old man’s folly: materials shipped from all over the world would, theoretically, be combined to form 128 miles of rail line, spanning 60 miles of unobstructed water, touching occasionally at rocky, mangrove-filled, generally inhospitable islands. Even drinking water would have to be imported.Despite the odds, by 1908 half of the rails had been laid, but the seven-mile span of open water between Marathon and Bahia Honda Keys was left to navigate. (Incidentally, it was the Overseas Railroad workers who christened Marathon Key, thanks to the seemingly endless and torturous task of building the aforementioned seven-mile-long bridge.) The tiny isle of Pigeon Key served as the midpoint construction base for the project, housing over 400 men.At the time of its completion in 1912, Henry Flagler rode the train into Key West and received a hero’s welcome. Onlookers deemed the Key West Extension of the Overseas Railroad an engineering marvel and was called the Eighth Wonder of the World. One year later, Flagler died at the age of 82, never to know the way in which his railroad fundamentally changed the Florida Keys.Conversely, Flagler was spared the knowledge that the Key West Extension built as a result of sheer determination, would be destroyed after only 23 years of service. As part of the Great Depression’s New Deal, hundreds of unemployed men - mostly World War I veterans - were hired to build the bridges for the Overseas Highway with supplies delivered to three bases, including Pigeon Key, via Flagler’s rails.During the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, a belated attempt to usher the men at Pigeon Key to safety went horribly awry when the raging storm derailed their transport train at Islamorada, sending it tumbling into the ocean. The death toll was 432. Famed author Ernest Hemingway published a letter to the editor in which he called such gross negligence nothing less than murder, and correctly predicted that the 30-plus miles of rail destroyed in the storm would never be repaired.Upon the opening of an updated US Route 1 bridge in 1982, which bypassed Pigeon Key by a few hundred meters, the abandoned buildings were left to fall into disrepair in the scorching sun, pummeling storms and soporific breezes.Today, the Pigeon Key Foundation has restored the historical buildings, and installed a museum detailing the history behind the Overseas Railroad and the island. Visitors interested in a tour should meet at the old rail car serving as the Pigeon Key Gift Shop on Vaca Key. The price of admission includes a full day’s access to the museum, grounds, free snorkel equipment, and a ferry ride to/from Pigeon Key. Otherwise, the 2.2-mile-long section of the Old Seven Mile Bridge is open to pedestrian, cycling, and golf cart traffic (though please be prepared for the scorching sun, as nary a speck of shade can be found).

953,The Sword in the Stone at Montesiepi Chapel,"relics,relics and reliquaries,weapons,saints,ruins",195,867,"The sword King Arthur pulled from the stone in legend was likely just that–legendary. This sword, with a story equally as unbelievable, actually exists in Tuscany’s Montesiepi Chapel.Galgano Guidotti was born in 1148 near Chiusdino. After spending his youth as a wealthy knight, in 1180 Giudotti decided to follow the words of Jesus and retired as a hermit near his hometown. He began to experience visions of the Archangel Michael, leading him to God and the twelve apostles on the hill of Monte Siepi. In one vision, Michael told Guidotti to renounce all of his earthly possessions. He responded that this would be as difficult as splitting a stone, and to prove his point, thrust his sword into a rock. To his surprise, the sword went through the impenetrable surface as though it was water. Shortly after, an errant horse led Guidotti to the very hilltop that had appeared in his visions, where he was moved to plant a cross. Not having any wood handy, he plunged his sword into a rock, just as he had in the vision, where it was embedded for all time. One year later Guidotti died, and in 1185 Pope Lucius the 3rd declared him a saint, and the Montesiepi Chapel was built up around it.Allegedly countless people have tried to steal the sword. On display at the chapel are the mummified hands of a thief who tried to remove the sword and was suddenly slaughtered by wild wolves. Why only the hands survived is unexplained, but they serve as a warning to would-be sword snatchers. These days the sword is protected by a Perspex shield as well as the disembodied hands.While the sword was considered a fake for years, recent studies examined the sword and the hands, and the dating results, as well as the metal and style of the sword, all are consistent with the late 1100s–early 1200s. While it’s impossible to verify the sword’s legendary history, it does match up with Saint Galgano Giudotti’s timeline.",This sword isn't waiting for a king to pull it out.

The building’s bricks were made by nearby Folsom and San Quentin inmates and shipped via rail to Ione, in California’s Sierra Foothills, where the castle was built.The state legislature had ordered construction of the building to serve as a juvenile rehabilitation correctional facility. By 1894 the castle was complete and the Preston School of Industry was opened. At the military-styled school wards spent half their days in school and the other half learning a trade that could support them after their release. The facility served as home to the school until 1960 when it was moved to newer nearby buildings.For the next forty years the castle remained abandoned, until 2001 when a fifty-year lease was given to The Preston Castle Foundation. The foundation has since been working to preserve and restore the castle. The building has been named as a California Historical Landmark (#867) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NPS-75000422).It has long been said that the castle is haunted and it has been investigated by a variety of ghost hunters. Several deaths occurred at the castle throughout the years, but it is believed to be haunted by Anna Corbin, a housekeeper who was found beaten to death in 1950.

956,Battersea Power Station,"power stations,industrial,music,abandoned",1352,869,"The massive Battersea Power Station once generated power for a large portion of London, but now the abandoned complex just provides headaches for developers.Construction on the gigantic building began in 1929 after a great deal of public outcry. The community surrounding the massive build site was concerned that the proposed power station would simply become a smoke-belching eyesore. These concerns were addressed with the installation of a scrubbing system which removed a great deal of the polluting smoke from the emissions, and the appearance of the building was given over to a famed industrial designer. This focus on the complex’s design led to the famed Art Deco lines and unmistakable quartet of white smokestacks which make up the exterior of the building. Structurally, the station was built as two identical coal-burning facilities fashioned in the “brick cathedral” style. In fact, the power station remains the largest brick building in England.The coal-powered stations provided the city of London with power for over 30 years, but by 1983, both of the facilities had ceased operation and the complex was abandoned. With the building idle, talk of demolishing the site quickly began. Luckily, the power station had become an icon in pop culture thanks to its prominent appearance in a number of media from the Beatles film Help! to the cover of Pink Floyd’s album Animals. With the culture’s eye on the site, it was able to escape destruction a number of times over the years as the building passed from owner to owner, the target of countless projects which would never see completion. Each new owner had a new vision for the abandoned complex from converting it into a theme park to building an eco-dome within its walls, but each and every one ran into some difficulty.Currently the site is owned by a group of investors who are turning the empty complex into housing units, offices (including Apple’s headquarters), shops, and restaurants. The Battersea Power Station was also recently recognized by the World Monuments Fund as a site in need of protection and this, hopefully, will power some progress in any revitalization efforts.   ",Pop culture has helped to keep this iconic British building from being destroyed. ,"Chelsea Physic Garden,575 Wandsworth Road,Brown Dog Statue","188 Kirtling St London, England, SW8 United Kingdom",51.4817,-0.1446,EricGrundhauserXoanLuis MoratoMartinjooniurRachelllwhermenaummawawi9806jooniurXXoanLuis MoratoffrankieneriniMMartingmgalasso61Rachel,2013-11-05 00:00:00,"Brown Dog Statue,Chelsea Physic Garden,575 Wandsworth Road,The Morpeth Arms","Tres Xemeneies (Three Chimneys),Zesco Cooling Tower,'Jumping Jack' Power Plant,Guignard Brick Works",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/battersea-power-station
957,Antikythera Mechanism,"astounding timepieces,long now locations,retro-tech,instruments of science,inventions,collections",478,869,"For over 2,000 years, a shipwreck lay off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera, its hidden treasures slowly corroded by the Mediterranean. It wasn’t until 1900 that sponge divers happened upon the loot, and found therein a perplexing device of remarkable engineering - though the divers had no idea how truly remarkable it was at the time. The device sat in a museum for fifty years before historians began to take a serious look at it.Known as the Antikythera mechanism and called a “clockwork computer,” this small bronze instrument is unique because it precedes any machine of comparable complexity by more than a millennium.The mechanism was built circa 200 BC, and, with over thirty gears hidden behind its dials, it is easily the most advanced technological artifact of the pre-Christian period. Regarded as the first known analog computer, the mechanism can make precise calculations based on astronomical and mathematical principles developed by the ancient Greeks. Although its builder’s identity and what it was doing aboard a ship remain mysteries, scientists have worked for a century to piece together the mechanism’s history.Somewhat surprisingly, most consider it unlikely that the Antikythera mechanism was a navigational tool. The harsh environment at sea would have presented a danger to the instrument’s delicate gears, and features such as eclipse predictions are unnecessary for navigation. The mechanism’s small size, however, does suggest that it was designed with portability in mind. According to some researchers, a more plausible story is that the mechanism was used to teach astronomy to those with little knowledge of the subject.To use the instrument, you would simply enter a date using a crank, and, when the gears stopped spinning, a wealth of information appear at your fingertips: the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, the lunar phase, the dates of upcoming solar eclipses, the speed of the Moon through the sky, and even the dates of the Olympic games. Perhaps most impressively, the mechanism’s calendar dial could compensate for the extra quarter-day in the astronomical year by turning the scale back one day every four years. The Julian calendar, which was the first in the region to include leap years, was not introduced until decades after the instrument was built.While the Antikythera mechanism is the only known artifact of its kind, its precise engineering and the fact that similar instruments were described in contemporary writing lend strong support to the notion that it was not unique. It is thought that the famous inventor Archimedes of Syracuse constructed comparable devices. Some believe that the instrument came from the school of the astronomer Hipparchus. Whoever the builder was, they were likely Greek, as evidenced by the written instructions that are attached to the instrument’s face.Today, the Antikythera mechanism is housed is in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. A replica of the mechanism is also on view at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana. When Jacques-Yves Cousteau made his last visit to the shipwreck in 1978, he found no additional pieces. Nevertheless, the device continues to reveal its secrets to the researchers of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, an international effort supported by various universities and technology companies.",2000-year-old computer demonstrates remarkable engineering and astronomical precision. ,"The Blue Polykatoikia,The Athens Polytechnic Monument,Austrian Archaeological Institute at Athens","44, Patission Str.

But the No Scum Allowed Saloon is a living relic of the area’s history as a gold rush boomtown and haven for some of the Wild West’s most infamous outlaws.White Oaks got its start in 1879 after a trio of prospectors discovered gold in the nearby Jicarilla mountains. The population ballooned and it quickly became New Mexico Territory’s liveliest and second-largest town. During its heyday, the Wild West boomtown boasted several newspapers, two hotels, an opera house, and a multitude of saloons, gambling houses, and brothels. Not unexpectedly, White Oaks became a refuge for cattle rustlers, gamblers, gunmen, and all sorts of other outlaws and desperadoes. It was not uncommon to see Billy the Kid and Lincoln County sheriff Pat Garrett wandering the dusty streets. Deputy sheriff James Bell, who was gunned down by Billy during his escape from the Lincoln County Jail in 1881, is buried, along with numerous other notables, in the local cemetery.In the 1890s, White Oaks began its decline after the hoped-for railroad never arrived and the mines became depleted. Today, while many historic buildings are still standing, the most popular draw in this otherwise sleepy and isolated ghost town with a mere handful of residents is the No Scum Allowed Saloon. Known by locals simply as the “White Oaks Bar,” its more popular moniker originates from the movie Young Guns II in which the sign at the entrance to White Oaks states “We will not tolerate scum.”The bar is located in a small 1884 brick building that originally served during the Wild West days as an attorney’s office, a print shop for one of the town’s first newspapers, and an assay office. Since the saloon opened in the 1970s, its historical allure has regularly attracted a wide diversity of clientele including ranchers, cowboys, bikers, musicians and, of course, numerous curiosity seekers and tourists. Recognized as one of the best cowboy bars in the West by American Cowboy Magazine, the No Scum Allowed Saloon is home to cold beer as well as live music and dancing, especially on Saturday nights.

Within the canyon are the Delores Mission Ruins, the remains of Wineglass Ranch which belonged to a prominent 19th century ranching family, tracks from the Santa Fe Trail, numerous Fremont era native American archeological sites, a few ghosts from a lost troop of conquistadors.But the real reason people visit the Picketwire, bastardized from the poetic name, is to see the tracks of strolling dinosaurs along a large inland sea from the Jurassic era.The dinosaur trackway contains 1300 tracks in 100 separate trackways over a quarter mile limestone deposits on either side of river. Most of the tracks are from either Apatosaurus or Allosaurus. The apatosaurus tracks are the most prominent and indicate herding behavior with the larger tracks flanking either side of several smaller tracks.The allosaur tracks are those of a single animal hunting the apatosaurs. One shows a distinct slide in the mud as it makes a sharp turn to avoid the allosaur. Recent removal of sediments on top of the track way show several allosaurs that may be hunting together. The allosaurus tracks show animals approaching with long strides and going into a short stride stalk. One may even show one of three allosaurs “springing” towards prey. This is the first set of tracks you see when you approach the river.There are other, older, indications of dinosaur behavior not usually seen in track ways as well.  One area, called the “trample” zone, is just a series of overlying tracks in an area that seems to be, well, trampled. But upon closer inspection, long round furrows can be seen in the ground.  These are tail drags which indicate mating behavior as the apatosaurus had a rigid upright tail. The trackway is just part of the canyon’s rich and haunting history. The River of Souls Lost in Purgatory gets its name, and its ghosts, from a Spanish expedition lead by Francisco Leyva de Bonilla, a Portuguese captain in service to Spain and Capt. Pedro de Cazorlá, a Spanish captain. They were originally chasing Native American raiders but the stories of Quivira woven by the Pecos Pueblo Indians filled Bonilla’s head with thoughts of glory. Cazorlá claimed that Bonilla was committing treason to the Spanish Crown and returned with a portion of the force to Peco Pueblo.  Bonilla and his lieutenant, Antonio Gutiérrez de Humaña, pressed onward towards the high plains of Colorado.  Because Bonilla was Portuguese, Humaña, chafed at taking orders from him and he argued with Bonilla over the campfire one night.  Hot words were exchanged and Bonilla lay dead, his blood dripping from the dagger of Antonio Gutiérrez de Humaña.The priests with the troop upon seeing Bonilla lying in a pool of blood vowed that they would not follow a murderer nor would they administer rights or communion to anyone who would. Along with a small band they returned to New Spain, leaving Humaña in command of a diminished, but still determined troop. Gold and glory were far more important to Humaña than sanctimonious priests! Humaña pushed on over Raton Pass and into the maw of the Comanche nation.On the edge of a canyon of a small high plains creek, the Comanche surrounded the force at a place called the La Matanza, or “The Slaughter,” and drove them to the edge with a grass fire. They then killed them to a man. Having no priest to offer them last rites or absolution, their souls were condemned to wander the banks of this insignificant river pouring out of the Spanish Peaks for eternity. Their moans of grief can still be heard echoing in the canyons of this tiny river. ",The largest dinosaur trackway in North America is tucked away among this canyon's ghosts and archaeological gems. ,"Bent's Old Fort,Art Cartopia Museum,Ludlow Massacre Site","2000-2162 Co Rd 25 La Junta, Colorado United States",37.6594,-103.6203,cyccommuteswebelylvahemingwaygyro,2016-11-01 00:00:00,"Bent's Old Fort,Ludlow Massacre Site,Art Cartopia Museum,Steam Engine 638","Capitalsaurus Court,Laurel Dinosaur Park,Dinosaur State Park,Mammoth Site",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/picketwire-canyon-trackway

In fact there are 23 foam and steel giants hanging from the walls and ceilings of the museum, each depicted in an accurate-as-possible 1:1 scale.The collection includes a variety of species including oversized dolphins such as the Beluga whale and the Orca, as well as massive baleen varieties such as Bowhead, Humpback, and Blue whales. Each specimen is bathed in a haunting blue light and aquatic sounds that sells the sensationalized illusion of seeing the beasts in their natural habitat. Each of the peaceful animals is accompanied by an information stand that gives visitors information about what makes each species unique.The Whales of Iceland exhibition was explicitly created to cater to the growing tourist population in Reykjavik but it is also devoted to educating visitors about the country’s conservation efforts, hoping to escape their image as a whaling nation.

From this simple accident a tourist attraction was born.The owners, the Cooper family, say the building slid down the hill because of a magnetic force, that forms what the Coopers call a “vortex.” This force, they claim, also causes all sorts of other “paranormal activity” around the hill, where balls appear to roll uphill and broomsticks seem to stand on end. The Cooper family also claims that the Native Americans thought this space was forbidden ground, and their horses would not enter it, though local Native Americans may say otherwise.Skeptics, and those with a good pair of eyes or sense of orientation, will point out that it is the distorted building that makes the objects and people around it appear at different heights.

But other times, abandoned structures take on a new semi-natural life all their own, like a crab who uses a jar for a shell. Such is the case with the Newnes railroad tunnel.The Newnes railroad was closed in 1932 after 25 years of shipping oil shale. The rails were pulled out of the 600-meter tunnel, which had been bored through the sandstone in the Wollemi National Park, and the tunnel was left to its own devices. For Newnes, that meant becoming home to thousands and thousands of glow worms.The glow worm is a catch-all name for the bioluminescent larvae of various species, in this case, the Arachnocampa richardsae, a type of fungus gnat. Found in massive numbers in caves, the fungus gnat larvae cling to the rocky walls of the abandoned tunnel and hunt with long, glowing strings of sticky mucus.To see the glowing gnats, enter the tunnel during daylight hours, and head to the middle - it gets dark in the middle where there is a bend in the tunnel - with a flashlight, so as not to bump into the walls. Turn off the light and wait a minute or two. One by one, the gnats will begin to shine like stars emerging in the night.A similar cave can be found in New Zealand at the Waitomo Glow Worm Cave. ","Once the path of a railway tunnel, now home to thousands of glowing insects. ","Big Kookaburra,Big Miner's Lamp,Big Blue Heeler","Wolgan Valley Putty, 2330 Australia",-32.8739,150.4922,wytheBlindcolourmbison,2014-02-09 00:00:00,"Big Miner's Lamp,Big Blue Heeler,Big Kookaburra,Odd Mountain","Naples Underground,Stumphouse Tunnel,Old Tunnel Bat Colony,Upton Chamber ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/newnes-glow-worm-tunnel

Moore preferred feathers, and became one of the more well-known conservationists and ornithologists of the early 20th century. Moore was a bird lover beginning at a very young age. He traveled across North and South America to study, observe, and document these creatures that endlessly fascinated him, and he is credited with discovering at least four new species, amassing in the process one of largest collections of birds in the world. His collection contains an incredible 60,000 different specimens, including the tufted jay, the masked mountain-tanager, the maroon-fronted parrot, and the Balsas screech-owl. In 1950, Moore decided to give his collection to Occidental College in Los Angeles. He constructed the building it was to be housed in, now known as the Moore Lab of Zoology, and gave an endowment ensuring the maintenance, upkeep, and further studying of his massive collection. In 1952, the Moore Lab of Zoology was dedicated. Moore passed away six years later knowing that his love of birds would carry on to the next generation. Today, the building still stands and the collection is still growing. Now at 64,121 specimens, it is among the world’s largest research natural history collections. Birds that have been extinct for years, like the world’s largest woodpecker, are preserved here, ensuring that amateur ornithologists, like Robert Moore himself, will be able to enjoy and study these birds for years to come. ",One of the world's largest collections of rare and magnificent bird specimens. ,"Galco's Soda Pop Stop,Egasse-Braasch House,Bob Baker Marionette Theater","1600 Campus Road  Los Angeles, California, 90042 United States",34.1265,-118.21,Matt BlitzAnnetta BlackhanamrenicheRachelMartin,2013-02-15 00:00:00,"Bob Baker Marionette Theater,Galco's Soda Pop Stop,Egasse-Braasch House,Highland Park Bowl","Anniston Museum,Asiatic Leopard Diorama ,Scavenger Taxidermy Diorama ,Royal Museum for Central Africa Natural History Collections",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-moore-lab-of-zoology-los-angeles-california

And for a pause, the Victorian era visitors stopped by Sybil’s Cave, a spring carved in the hill.The manmade cave was excavated 30 feet to a natural spring in 1832, and then an elaborate Gothic-style entrance was built in front of it. Visitors could sit down at a table and spend a penny on a cool glass of spring water, which by one 19th century report was described as “slightly impregnated with magnesia.”Yet the real surge of visitors came in the summer of 1841 when Mary Rogers, known in the press as the “Beautiful Cigar Girl,” was found murdered near Sybil’s Cave, a crime which to this day has not been solved. Spurred by the tabloid press, gawkers came in hordes, and even increased in number after the suicide by poison by her fiancé Daniel Payne near the cave, after he was tormented by the accusations and the grief.However, after the grisly fame faded and the Victorian strollers departed, the area turned to industry and the cave was destroyed in the 1930s. The waterfront was taken over by warehouses, and it wasn’t until 2007 that the cave was again excavated after some explorers rediscovered it after intense searching.

As such, people were surprised when, in 1956, brothers Bob and Jack Thornton took out a hefty loan to bring South Seas flair to South Florida in the form of the Mai-Kai Restaurant. The gamble paid off: The novelty spot was a hit, grossing $1 million in its first year. For those who couldn’t afford to fly to Tahiti or Hawaii, a tiki bar in Florida was plenty authentic. Customers were drawn into the towering A-frame structure by the warm glow of tiki torches out front. The decor and magnitude of the place really sold it. For example, a massive Tahitian canoe from the owner’s wedding was strung from the ceiling among fishing buoys and palm leaves. The bar was constructed of surfboards, lined nose to tail along the length of the numerous dining rooms.But the floor show, which still goes strong today, was the Mai-Kai’s truly unique selling point. Dancers and flame-throwers, many of whom hailed from Polynesian islands, performed nightly shows. The perceived exoticism of these performances, not to mention the fact that waitresses and bartenders alike were scantily clad in bikinis and sarongs, made the Mai-Kai’s simple dinner-and-a-show format seem like a destination worth traveling for on its own.The Mai-Kai has been placed on Florida’s National Register of Historic Places. Since its opening it has almost doubled in size. The eight dining rooms are each themed after different Polynesian Islands, though in all truth, no Polynesian Island ever looked like the Mai-Kai.

The rustic serenity of soil underfoot, the organic fragrance that fills the air – experiencing the spoils of nature untouched and undisturbed by civilization is typically the objective of many hikers.Sculpture, on the other hand, is mankind’s response to nature. It is the molding of materials, the fashioning of unnatural shapes and figures into the raw offerings of the wilderness. It is the art form most directly disruptive to the natural state of things, but also the one with which nature is most intricately intertwined.It makes sense, then, for sculpture gardens to be more and more commonly mixed into nature preserves and hiking destinations throughout the world, and they are. From the Route of Faces in Spain to the Hill of Witches in Lithuania, artists are starting to come together to pay tribute to nature by way of decoration – providing an homage to the materials they use by placing them back into the wild from whence they came.The Andres Institute of Art and its sculpture garden are joining the movement, decorating the hiking trails and rugged vistas that surrounds its New Hampshire home with subdued but evocative sculpture and artistry.Usually, one looks to corporate business parks, museum courtyards and corners of city parks to find a sculpture garden of any magnitude. But at the Andres Institute, works large and small from artists around the globe have been gathered and placed throughout the countryside, allowing both hiking and art appreciation in one silent trek.There are those who say nature should remain unspoiled, and art should be examined and dissected in a proper, setting, shielded from the influence of the elements. But with something as raw and natural as sculpture, it may make the most sense out of anything to view, unnaturally, in its natural environment.",Around 100 sculptures from artists all over the world decorate the hiking trails surrounding this locale. ,"The Uncle Sam House,Monson, New Hampshire,Harriet E.

In addition to a small Montmartre boutique crammed with treasures, there is a vast stand in the Marché Vernaison which feels a little like a surrealist supermarket.Curated almost like an art gallery or museum (only a lot more fun), this collection of ephemera ranges from the end of the 19th century to the 1980s. You’ll find pristine packets of toilet paper from the 1930s, old wooden typographic stamps, glass doll’s eyes by the thousands, fake tattoos from the 1960s, poison jars, wartime postcards, heavy old coffin handles, and bicycle-shaped sunglasses from the Tour de France.

977,Fingal's Cave,"jules verne,geological oddities,caves,music,natural wonders,ecosystems,water,geology,nature",535,5711,"Queen Victoria, Matthew Barney, Jules Verne, and Pink Floyd are not names you usually hear in the same sentence, but then the place that they all share is itself quite uncommon. Known as Fingal’s Cave, it bears a history and geology unlike any other cave in the world.At 72 feet tall and 270 feet deep, what makes this sea cave so visually astoundingly is the hexagonal columns of basalt, shaped in neat six-sided pillars that make up its interior walls. These fractured columns form a crude walkway just above the water level so that visitors can go far inside and explore the cave.The cave was a well-known wonder of the ancient Irish and Scottish Celtic people and was an important site in the legends. Known to the Celts as Uamh-Binn or “The Cave of Melody,” one Irish legend, in particular, explained the existence of the cave as well as that of the similar Giant’s Causeway in Ireland. As both are made of the same neat basalt columns, the legend holds that they were the end pieces of a bridge built by the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (a.k.a. Finn McCool), so he could make it to Scotland where he was to fight Benandonner, his gigantic rival.The legend, which connects the two structures, is in effect geologically correct. Both the Giant’s Causeway and Fingal’s Cave were indeed created by the same ancient lava flow, which may have at one time formed a “bridge” between the two sites. Of course, this happened some 60 million years ago, long before people would have been around to see it. Nonetheless, the deductive reasoning of the ancient peoples formed the connection and base of the legend that the two places must be related.The cave was rediscovered when naturalist Sir Joseph Banks visited it in 1772. At the time of Banks’ discovery, Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books was a very popular poetic series, supposedly translated from an ancient Gaelic epic by Irish poet James Macpherson. The book was an influence on Goethe, Napoleon, and Banks, who promptly named the Scottish cave, which already had the name Uamh-Binn, after the Irish legend, calling it “Fingal’s Cave.”And though Banks is responsible for both rediscovering and renaming the cave, it would be a romantic German composer who truly vaulted the cave to world fame.So moved was famed composer Felix Mendelssohn by the splendor of the cave that he sent the opening phrase of an overture on a postcard to his sister with the note: “In order to make you understand how extraordinarily the Hebrides affected me, I send you the following, which came into my head there.” The Hebrides Overture, also known as Fingal’s Cave, premiered on May 14, 1832, in London. (The original name may have been based on the amazing noises the cave sometimes produces.)In a one-two Romantic punch, artist J. M. W. Turner painted “Staffa, Fingal’s Cave” in the same year and together these launched the cave from a little-known wonder into a must-see Romantic-Victorian tourist site. William Wordsworth, John Keats, Lord Tennyson, and Queen Victoria all visited the cave as did consummate traveler and lover of wonders, Jules Verne.After this, the cave never left the public imagination. Pink Floyd named one of their early, unreleased songs after the cave, and Matthew Barney used the cave in his Cremaster cycle.One can visit the cave via cruise (though boats cannot enter the cave, they make regular passes by it) or can travel to the small island of Staffa and hike into the cave by stepping from column to column. By the way, northern shores of Staffa host a puffin colony during the summer months.",This astonishingly geometric cave has inspired everyone from Jules Verne to Pink Floyd. ,"Clach Na Criche (The Wishing Stone) ,Iona Abbey,'The Unsoiling of Rockall'","Fingal's Cave Isle of Staffa, Scotland, PA73 6NA United Kingdom",56.4314,-6.3413,DylanBlindcolourssm67albahrnickTeaAndCoffeeLoverfollowtheblindfollowtheblindKenJssm67albaTeaAndCoffeeLoverRachel PreskittBlindcolourrrhumphrey17bbgallmeisterracheldoylehrnickMMartinccutedanJaszmina SzendreyNicholas Jackson,2011-07-02 00:00:00,"Iona Abbey,Clach Na Criche (The Wishing Stone) ,'The Unsoiling of Rockall',World Stone Skimming Championship","Kong Lor Cave,Marble Caves of Chile Chico,Boca do Inferno,Vortex Spring",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fingal-s-cave

From that day forward, Bedford began using all of his energy and heaps of unique objects and recycled metal to construct one of the world’s most hidden, out-of-place, and extravagantly designed art houses.Known as “Vanadu,” Clarke Bedford’s peculiar art house is filled with a large collection of antiques, junk, and historical objects. Throughout the high-density cluster of sculptures and mosaics you’ll find a horned wooden owl, a black and white striped cone, a skull, a statue of John Locke, a German language globe stuffed inside a rusted horn, and a woman’s face covered in glass and colored fragments of junk.Clarke Bedford also owns four fully functional art cars, made of everything from car parts to used washing machine pieces and moose antlers, which are typically placed on the curbside of the art house. The most famous car, the traveling Vanadu Ford, features vases and horns on the sides and graveyard spires on the roof, and it even has its own Facebook account. When he was working as a conservator for the Hirshhorn Museum, Bedford would drive one of the elaborate silver cars on his daily commute to work, and to this day the art cars remain one of Bedford’s major sources of transportation.Clarke Bedford’s named his art car and house “Vanadu” to honor the poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose famous “Kubla Khan” poem emerged from an opium-induced dream about the ancient Chinese city of Xanadu, once under the rule of Mongol emperor Kublai Khan. In addition to “Vanadu,” Bedford also calls his assemblage of recycled materials the Assemblage Cottage, pronounced with a French accent as “As-sem-blage Co-ttage.”",An intricately designed junk art house with four extravagant junk art cars hidden in the suburbs.  ,"William Hilleary House,Bladensburg Dueling Grounds,Bostwick House","3808 Nicholson St Hyattsville, Maryland United States",38.9607,-76.9541,lewblanktommimeckley2e1savagemichaelnhartmansadbread99MarcusLocalhost,2016-11-28 00:00:00,"William Hilleary House,Bladensburg Dueling Grounds,Bostwick House,Fort Lincoln Cemetery ","Pasaje Lanín,Asakura Gallery,Kristek's House,Vera Cruz",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vanadu-art-house

Saunter along the street—which is complete with a jail, cantina, and general store—and you’ll feel as though you’ve stepped onto the set of a Wild West film.The street’s facade was designed by Michael Faulkner, with help from the Euro Disney engineers who created the lettering. It was meant to cover the exterior of the old cinema that the furniture company was based in.The company that created this transplanted sliver of America’s Wild West has since gone out of business, giving the street an even more ghost town-like atmosphere as the facade has fallen into disrepair.

981,U-Drop Inn,"route 66,cars,roadside attractions",380,863,"Built in 1936, the U-Drop Inn in Shamrock, Texas, was kind of a big deal. With its prime location on iconic Route 66, the café with its connected Tower Station was one of the first commercial businesses along the route. The road itself was a fairly new addition to the country’s landscape, with the roadway being designated Route 66 just ten years earlier.  This Art Deco building included the Tower Conoco Station, so named for the metal tulip-topped tower attached to the building; a café, which was given the name U-Drop Inn by a local student who won a building naming contest (and five dollars); and a space that was to hold retail. At one time, the U-Drop Inn was called “the swankiest of swank eating places” and “the most up-to-date edifice of its kind on U.S. Highway 66 between Oklahoma City and Amarillo.” The café was the only the one around in a 100 mile radius, so it wasn’t just swanky, it was crowded. The space that was to be used as retail was converted to additional café seating and a ballroom the next year.But while the implementation of national highway system in 1956 brought speed and efficiency to American travelers, it also meant a decline in patrons for businesses along Route 66, and the U-Drop Inn was no exception. When the highways came in, Shamrock was one of the towns bypassed; the formerly famous U-Drop Inn fell into disrepair and was eventually abandoned. As Shamrock Economic Development Corporation director Larry Clonts explained, “When the freeway started and got complete, the town started going down from the lack of people because they quit traveling as an adventure.”A $1.7 million federal grant in 2003 gave the U-Drop Inn a second chance. The building, which is now owned by the city, was restored to its former glory and now includes a visitor’s center and the city’s Chamber of Commerce.  Inside you’ll also find a retro cafe and soda fountain, and friendly servers will reverentially point out the booth where Elvis once sat. Another new addition? A Tesla Supercharger charging station for electric cars. The restored building is a bit of road trip nostalgia that has reinvigorated Shamrock. Clonts noted,“For our travelers that you’re seeing come and go all the time here, which are by the thousands, it’s a piece of history.” ","Once in disrepair, this popular Texas stop along iconic Route 66 has been restored to its past glory. ","Devil's Rope Museum,1929 Phillips 66 Station,The Wheeler Historical Museum ","1242 N Main St Shamrock, Texas United States",35.2267,-100.2486,Ashawntaraymondwinn1941Keren LynnCycloniccait7911The CoppersTThe Coppersccait7911breaingramKeren LynnCollector of ExperienceserjefferyCCyclonicrraymondwinn1941MMartin,2017-11-29 00:00:00,"The Wheeler Historical Museum ,Devil's Rope Museum,1929 Phillips 66 Station,'Cast Away' Crossroads","Hackberry General Store,AA Sentry Box #289,Seaba Station Motorcycle Museum,The Aztec Hotel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/udrop-inn
982,Abbey Library of Saint Gall,"libraries,architectural oddities,architecture",218,863,"There are beautiful old libraries, and then there is the Abbey Library of Saint Gall, which may not only be one of the oldest surviving libraries in Europe, but certainly one of the most beautiful. According to the Abbey of Saint Gall’s website (Abtei St. Gallen in German), the earliest evidence of a library collection on the site dates back to around 820 CE, in plans that show a library attached to the main church.The Abbey is said to have followed the Rule of St. Benedict, a portion of which prescribes the study of literature, should a library be available, so it is no wonder that the abbey itself would have been built with one. As the abbey grew over the years, so did its library, and soon the site became known for its collection of illuminated manuscripts and writings, as well as a leading center for science and Western culture around the 10th century. In the mid-18th century, the world-renowned collection was moved to a new library space which was lavishly decorated in a Baroque rococo style. Elaborate artworks were installed in the ceiling which was framed by flowing, curved moldings, giving the space a timeless and fantastical aspect.The wooden balconies are shaped into flowering shapes and designs. Oh, and the books from the historic collection are also on display if you can look past their surroundings to pay attention to them. Today the library at St. Gall is still considered nearly unrivaled in its beauty. It also now holds one of the more important collections in the world, covering 12 centuries of non-stop collecting. The collection even includes the first example of an architectural plan on parchment.

To play, you need to basically sign your life away - this is dangerous stuff; it’s hard to even use a backyard trampoline without spraining an ankle or stepping on your sister’s head - but it’s worth it.Seven days a week, the public flocks to the House of Air to defy gravity as much as is possible only a few minutes from home. The athletic and recreational facility hosts aerial and physical training sessions, trampoline jump time, trampoline dodgeball and basketball games, and fitness classes. The location is often rented out for corporate events, birthday parties, and big family gatherings.The Presidio Trust explains the genesis of the idea: “The idea for House of Air was developed seven years ago by Dave Schaeffer and Paul McGeehan during one of many long drives back from snowboarding in Lake Tahoe. Its mission of ‘giving flight to the flightless,’ embodied in its mascot, a penguin wearing a jetpack, is a fitting reuse for building 926, which once helped launch De Havilland DH-48 biplanes as part of the Army’s 91st Observation Squadron. Built in 1921, the building originally served as Crissy Air Field’s land-plane hangar. Later it was used as a motor vehicle paint shop and office and storage space for the Army and is a contributing feature to the Presidio’s National Historic Landmark status. The Trust is overseeing the historic rehabilitation of the building which includes seismic upgrades, accessibility improvements, new building systems and other improvements.”","Inside an old airplane hangar, friends and strangers alike play on a massive trampoline. ","Hoppers Hands,The Walt Disney Family Museum,Presidio Pet Cemetery","926 Mason St. San Francisco, California, 94129 United States",37.8049,-122.4688,Nicholas Jacksonmurasane,2010-12-15 00:00:00,"Presidio Pet Cemetery,Hoppers Hands,The Walt Disney Family Museum,United States Marine Hospital Cemetery","Green Thumb,Cactus Joe's Blue Diamond Nursery,Huntsman & Sons,Curioporium",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-air

985,Republic of Kugelmugel,"spheres,micro-nations,outsider architecture",380,864,"The Republic of Kugelmugel (roughly, “spherical hill”) was originally constructed by the artist Edwin Lipburger and his son Nikolaus Lipburger in 1971, in a small Austrian town called Katzelsdorf. The building has 7.68 m in diameter and is constructed of timber blocks covered with zinc sheets. At first, it served as a painter’s atelier. But after some time local authorities informed the Lipburgers that spherical buildings were not allowed.In an attempt to protect their creation from being demolished, the Lipburgers created their own Kugelmugel township, complete with self-made street signs surrounding the sphere. Later, as the legal dispute escalated, Edwin Lipburger attempted to declare the structure as its own federal state, the Republic of Kugelmugel, even going so far as to issue his own stamps and currency and refusing to pay taxes. The elder Lipburger was eventually sent to jail, for 10 weeks in 1979, for the offense of putting up unapproved street signs.The key to understanding Kugelmugel is that it was founded as a “republic” both as an artistic intervention and in order to protect the spherical house from being demolished. As an act of resistance, it earned quite a few fans. In the early 1980s, Austria’s culture minister, Helmuth Zilk, suggested Kugelmugel be moved to the Vienna Prater amusement park. The Lipburgers went along with the idea, having been promised access to tap water, electricity, and sewers. But these facilities were never provided, which resulted in a long-lasting dispute with the city of Vienna.Edwin Lipburger died in 2015, but Kugelmugel still sits in Vienna Prater, enclosed in barbed wire.

Mildred would live here until 1999, at which time the structure was donated to the City of Florence. The house is often considered the purest form of Wright’s Usonian style, a middle-class aesthetic developed following the turmoil of the Great Depression.Usonian (a partial acronym for United States of North America) homes were intended to be functional, affordable, and in tune with their surroundings. Horizontal lines and natural materials connect these structures to the land around them. Usonian homes also have plenty of glass windows, low-rising, cantilevered roofs, and an overhang for sheltering parked vehicles that Wright called a carport. The interior is constructed around an open living space with a central kitchen and there are many built-in bookshelves and storage spaces. It’s all very cozy. The Rosenbaums eventually had four sons, and asked Wright to design a much-needed extension several years after moving in. In 1948, an addition that included more sleeping arrangements and a Japanese garden was added, making Rosenbaum House the first Usonian to be significantly altered. Although such an interference may alarm some Wright devotees and architectural purists, Wright was thrilled. The fact that the building was flexible enough to be sensibly extended was, to him, a triumph of practicality.   ",This architectural triumph is the only Frank Lloyd Wright house in Alabama. ,"Key Underwood Coon Dog Cemetery,Rattlesnake Saloon,Wichahpi Commemorative Stone Wall ","601 Riverview Dr Florence, Alabama, 35630 United States",34.793,-87.6805,vonelliotthanainekehnbama60,2015-10-09 00:00:00,"Wichahpi Commemorative Stone Wall ,Rattlesnake Saloon,Key Underwood Coon Dog Cemetery,Woodall Mountain","Rudolph Ganz Memorial Hall,Polychrome Historic District,Frank Lloyd Wright Spire,Graycliff House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rosenbaum-house

Scenically located on a hill in San Pedro’s Angel’s Gate Park, this monument to friendship overlooks the Pacific Ocean that connects the shores of both countries.The bell itself, crafted according to traditional Korean bell-making techniques, is massive, measuring over 7 feet tall and weighing 17 tons. It was modeled after the Bronze Bell of King Songdok, which was cast in 771 and is still on display at the in the National Museum of Gyeongju.Around the bell’s circumference are reliefs of four pairs of goddesses, each pair symbolizing the spirits of freedom, independence, peace, and prosperity in the United States and South Korea. The personification of America is easily identifiable, as she takes the form of the Statue of Liberty.

989,Mount Elbert,"state high points,geographic markers,mountains",316,1030,"The highest point in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains, Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet above sea level, can be a straightforward hike. Just be aware of altitude sickness and afternoon lightning, and maybe supporters of another nearby mountain.Rising above all others in the Rocky Mountains, and the second-highest peak in the continental United States, the ascent up Mount Elbert on its simplest route can be a moderate four-mile hike to the summit. In the 1970s, supporters of the second-highest mountain in the Rockies, the nearby Mount Massive at just 12 feet shorter, would pile rocks on a cairn at the summit to bring it above Elbert because it is a more “deserving” peak with a much harder climb, a 7.8-mile scramble gaining over 4,500 vertical feet. Elbert supporters, however, would climb Massive and tear the cairn down.The standard route up this mountain, the South Mount Elbert Trail, is a gentle gradient through the San Isabel National Forest, filled with pines and aspen until the tree line. While the hike may be gentle, there are other concerns. Gray clouds with lightning develop near the peak almost daily from July through mid-August. If clouds develop, turn around, for the highest point in the Rockies is not the place to be when lightning strikes. Also, if a hiker is not used to the altitude and lower concentration of oxygen, the hiker may get a splitting headache that aspirin will not alleviate, and that could lead to a high altitude pulmonary or cerebral edema, which is fatal when no emergency services are available for miles. If a headache occurs and gets worse as one ascends, turn around.","At the tallest peak in Colorado, an electrifying mix of thin air, lightning, and rivalry. ","National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum,Temple Israel Museum,Tabor Opera House","Buena Vista, Colorado, 81211 United States 39.1178, -106.4453NearbyTemple Israel Museum12.04 milesTabor Opera House12.08 milesNational Mining Hall of Fame and Museum12.30 miles",39.1178,-106.4453,thomasharpersimpsonamanda8Darrell Powerskendallrmnpcrystaldawnwylie,2014-07-23 00:00:00,"Temple Israel Museum,Tabor Opera House,National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum,Leadville's Abandoned Silver Mine","Denali,Mount Rainier,Gannett Peak,Mount Hood",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-elbert

It has won the distinction as the most photographed house in Maine, but is better known as the Wedding Cake House, for its frilly Gothic-inspired architecture, as well as the romantic folklore surrounding it.The legend of the house is that shortly after his wedding Captain Bourne had to ship out to sea. To apologize to his bride, he built the house as a wedding gift that would keep on giving.This story is apparently apocryphal, but Bourne and his wife did live in the home just after their marriage. Perhaps even more impressive is the fact that the skilled ship builder constructed the entire house with his own two hands.The home, which is sometimes open to the public (often as a fundraiser for a charitable cause) was occupied by three generations of Bournes before being sold outside of the family in 1983.

Located at their private residence, Portrack House, near Dumfries, Scotland, the design, according to Jencks, brings out the basic elements that underlie the cosmos.From 1989 until Keswick’s death in 1995, Jencks and his wife met with horticulturists and scientists in order to design a landscape that would bridge the worlds of art, nature and science. Perhaps viewed as an unconventional approach to landscaping, the garden features a dizzying display of geometric fractals that all illuminate—or at least are inspired by—concepts of black holes, string theory, and the “Big Bang.”The garden features five major areas connected by a number of artificial lakes, bridges, and other architectural works, including large white staircases and terraces that zigzag down a green hillside, representing the story of the creation of the universe.Jencks continued work on the garden through 2007. Today, it is open to the public one day a year through the Scotland’s Gardens Scheme and helps to raise money for Maggie’s Centres, a cancer care foundation named after Jenck’s late wife.Update as of March 2020: The garden is currently closed until 2021.",A 30-acre garden inspired by the principles of modern physics. ,"The Ruthwell Cross,The Moffat Ram,Buittle Castle","1 Lower Portrack Cottages Holywood, Scotland, DG2 0RW United Kingdom",55.1301,-3.6663,anhieSEANETTAvturiserrakingoSporadicusmelodylzeilmannkkingoSSporadicuscmwhiteSEANETTAmmelodylzeilmannvturiserra,2010-01-15 00:00:00,"The Ruthwell Cross,Buittle Castle,The Moffat Ram,Lowther Hill Radar Station","Mildred E.

The metal make sits atop a three-foot sandstone pedestal like a classical Grecian bust and slowly dribbles water into a shallow basin.

996,Linda Vista Hospital,"abandoned hospitals,intriguing environs,ecosystems,abandoned,ruins",378,2482,"Opened in 1909 by the Santa Fe Railroad to serve its employees, the Moorish-style medical facility was a welcome sight in Boyle Heights.Razed and rebuilt in 1924, the Santa Fe Coast Line Hospital was reborn as a Mission Revival Style, top-notch institute now called Linda Vista. The hospital enjoyed many decades as the best care unit in the area – beautiful Santa Fe tile, highly trained staff and, at least in the early years, its own chickens, cows, and vegetable gardens to ensure that the patients had the freshest foods and dairy possible as they convalesced. But as the railroad industry, medical industry, and the very neighborhood itself changed with time, Linda Vista failed to keep up.By the 1970s, the Los Angeles suburb of Boyle Heights was no longer a lovely place to be, and with railroad employees opting for more mainstream medical care, Linda Vista was mostly treating the gunshot wounds and other violent crime injuries of the local community. After it instituted cutbacks to offset lack of funding, the operational shortcuts led to an increase in death rates. Between the high rate of violent crime mortality and the decreasing amount of resources, Linda Vista’s quality of care declined, doctors left, uninsured patients steadily grew, and the hospital was forced to close its doors for good in 1991.Ever-sprawling Los Angeles doesn’t have much use for empty, abandoned buildings. Linda Vista and its 6 stories of mission-style architecture and railroad history was sure to become an apartment building or strip mall, it was just a matter of time – but Linda Vista had one more reincarnation left in her. It seems in a city like Los Angeles, there just may be use for an old hospital, dusty, cobwebbed, and still full of the odds and ends of medical equipment and office trappings – a horror film set.The hospital was never deemed important enough to clean out, at least until sold to whatever company would eventually purchase it to turn it into something profitable, which would most likely mean tearing it down and starting over. When the the hospital closed, the few employees left just walked out – patient files remained lying open on counters, beds sat askew, some made, some not. With the building stripped of anything of worth, the flotsam left behind gave the eerie ghost vibe that is so appealing to horror fans – the frightening excitement of a place that harbored more deaths than one can imagine, where the caregivers who kept the misery in check have disappeared leaving nothing but injured souls behind. As dust gathered on the window sills of Linda Vista, so did the sense of unease.That unease was picked up by both film and TV location scouts, as well as ghost hunters and tours, and suddenly Linda Vista was bustling again. While the fate of the hospital is still uncertain, plans to renovate or turn it into condos have fallen short, mostly due to the high amounts of asbestos and lead contained within. Until then, paranormal operations and filming continue in earnest. As of 2013, Linda Vista’s creepy halls have starred in over 60 films, TV shows, and music videos.Recently, the former Linda Vista Hospital has been converted into senior apartment homes.","A hospital closed seemingly in the middle of operations, leaving behind fodder for horror films and ghost hunters. ","Evergreen Memorial Park & Crematory,River Under the First Bridge,Two Bit Circus Micro-Amusement Park","610 S.

The construction of the Cathedral started in 1989, when Hannemann was in his 20s. For a few years he collected junk for his project, but it was soon unnecessary as people began to supply him with their unwanted goods.Still a work in progress, the Cathedral of Junk is evolving. There once stood a three-story tower in the back of the Cathedral, but Hannemann tore it down thinking he was finally done with his long-lasting project. But instead of dismantling the Cathedral further, and after having had a change of heart, he added three more rooms to the structure with the pieces of the former tower.Seemingly hidden from the front of the house, the Cathedral is not completely invisible to neighbors. Tenants of a townhome complex located behind the house have filed complaints with the city, which in turn warranted inspection by officials. Several city engineers attempted to find weak-points in the structure, though it was found to be structurally sound and safe. Hannemann did have to destroy his pyramid of televisions, but many of these found a new home in the “zen garden of TVs”.The Cathedral of Junk is open often, however you must call ahead to make an appointment (512-299-7413) or you might end up stuck on the chair of despair.

Well then Kawasaki, Japan’s Anata No Warehouse (“Your Warehouse”), a video arcade dressed up to look like the seedy back alley of Hong Kong’s Kowloon Walled City, is just the place for you.The builders took painstaking care to recreate an essentialist version of the already pretty fantastical walled city, so it’s easy to forget that this is a modern video game arcade. Even on the outside, the facade of the modern commercial building in which the arcade is housed has been made to look like it is made of dripping, rusting sheet metal, abruptly reverting to the clean modern concrete of the adjoining structures at its borders. Once visitors pass through the rusty (that adjective can be used to describe a lot of the features in Anata No Warehouse) iron doors, they are transported to a back alley of the grimy fake Kowloon. Walking to the elevators there are windows that look into staged rooms where fake prostitutes lounge. All over the walls are moisture stains and ads for shady dental and medical services. All throughout the multiple floors of the facility, the theme never lets up save for the modern dinging and clanging of the actual games. Everything from the hallways to the bathrooms are covered in fake filth and authentically recreated ads and detritus.While building the arcade, the designers really did their homework, studying old photographs of Kowloon and its “atmosphere.” In addition to hand painting replica signs, the designers even had trash shipped over from Hong Kong so they could get a better idea of what that would look like.The theme holds true throughout most of the arcade until one leaves through the back exit which takes visitors through a few rooms that are straight up sci-fi-fantasy. From a strange tunnel bathed in red light, to a mist-covered pool that must be traversed via fake boulders, and a ying-yang door that would be at home in Big Trouble In Little China.

With the invention of robotics, the sexy statue has taken a step closer to reality.In the district of Kabukicho, the mecca of gentlemen’s entertainment in Tokyo, seizure-inducing flashing neon lights advertise the thousand and one earthly delights one can experience for money. But between hostess bars and soaplands stands a sexy storm trooper’s invite into one of the venues. Here the robots have their own techno-cabaret.A robot that can be programmed to act and look like a human female mate, albeit one that takes commands and won’t question authority, has a creepy undertone, but like Pygmalion offers a kind of perfected beauty without the possible pain of rejection.

The Dupont Circle station was constructed in 1949 and was unique in the streetcar system for being the only station that was built underground. It was in operation until the system was shut down and replaced by bus lines in 1962 and with plans for the Metro train system on the horizon.The discontinued streetcar station was briefly set up to be a fallout shelter in the case of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but even that function was ended in 1975 and the tunnels were sealed off and abandoned.In 1995, a developer bought the abandoned tunnels from the city and built an ill-fated food court, called Dupont Down Under, on the abandoned tracks, with a dozen fast food vendors all operating out of spaces designed to look like the old streetcars. The project was short-lived, however. Ventilation and lighting were poor, employees were miserable from working in the dank and windowless area all day, and customers were hesitant to go underground into abandoned tunnels for a bite to eat. Dupont Down Under was shut down in only a few months and the tunnels were abandoned once again.The tunnels were reopened to the public in late 2016, however, and the 75,000-square-foot former streetcar station is in the process of being converted into an artistic space.

Coppedè worked on the quarter until his death in 1927.Though the Art Nouveau palaces of Quartiere Coppedè, featuring floral, mythological and medieval details, are abundant, there is plenty of space for the fantasies of Coppedè in this vast area. “The 31,000 square meters of the quarter (with some 40 structures) are alive with Florentine towers and Venetian palazzi decorated with external mosaics and frescoes, Baroque Roman palazzi with real and imitation papal stemmata, a sundial, and even a building devoted to a musical decorative scheme whose exterior ironwork and carvings imitate musical notation” (Source).Thanks to its strange beauty, the Quartiere Coppedè has been used as the setting for a number of films, and is a fun way to leave the beaten path of Rome.",Architectureal fantasy quarter of Rome. ,"Saint Victoria's Incorruptible Body,Fontana dell'Acqua Felice,Casina delle Civette","Piazza Mincio Near Piazza Buenos Aires, main entrance from via Tagliamento Rome, 00198",41.9187,12.5024,athomiombisonmarqueeantoamendolakate a4e8ab6egingercinnamonaantoamendolakkate a4e8ab6egingercinnamontthebodyinthelibrarylhmzhouddiffendalemmbisonmmarqueeAnnetta Black,2009-09-09 00:00:00,"Casina delle Civette,Saint Victoria's Incorruptible Body,Fontana dell'Acqua Felice,Meridian Line of the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and the Martyrs","Whale House,El Nido de Quetzalcóatl,Mosaic Tile House,Géró Udvar",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quartiere-copped

Even so, a self-guided tour of the house can still take hours. Each themed room—some themes include a log cabin room, the French Renaissance room, and the Billiards Room—contains hundreds of pieces of art, books, and other “treasures” to examine and ponder. The mansion also includes also a large amount of Beatles and John Lennon memorabilia, including a Sgt. Peppers jukebox in the John Lennon Room.

The house was built in 1877 and purchased by the middle-class Batlló family in 1900 due to its central location and (originally) undesirable appearance. In 1904, Gaudí was commissioned to redesign the facade and interior of the structure, making it priceless.The facade is divided into three distinct sections, each reflecting a level of anatomy. The base level looks as though it is gridded by huge abstract bones, while above that the front takes on a more chaotic, abstract pattern echoing blood vessels and muscle, and then the entire structure is capped with a scaly roof section that looks like nothing so much as the back of a giant dragon.The interior of the building is no less organic. While Gaudí only remodeled an existing building, it would be hard to tell from the smooth, undulating insides of the large noble hall. Walking the halls is like strolling through the soft organs of some immense creature.The Batllós have long since vacated the building, but it is still open as a museum dedicated to the architect and visitors can experience the unique building for themselves. ","One of Antoni Gaudí's most classic buildings is well-known for its ""dragon-back"" design. ","Casa Amatller,Museu Egipci de Barcelona (Egyptian Museum of Barcelona),Tió de Nadal","43 Passeig de Gràcia Barcelona, 08007 Spain",41.3917,2.165,isidrondmassimiliano20097bsempowskiJaszmina SzendreybreaingramSchwegJR Wetmorebbsempowskisanpricamassimiliano20097akshayravenArchimedestonyanrobeepfromerbreaingramLuis MoratoNTrippingSSchwegJaszmina Szendrey,2014-04-28 00:00:00,"Casa Amatller,Museu Egipci de Barcelona (Egyptian Museum of Barcelona),Tió de Nadal,Lo Pinyol","Castel Meur,575 Wandsworth Road,Camino Real Sumiya,Castillo Carlota Palmerola",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/casa-batllo

This is the preserved corpse of the beautiful Saint Victoria.Incorruptible bodies are those believed to not succumb to the normal process of decomposition by way of divine intervention. But Saint Victoria’s body needed a little help. Her incomplete corpse was supplemented with wax and hair and clothes from someone else entirely, adorned with a crown of roses.Saint Victoria, the patron of Anticoli, Italy, was an early christian martyr. She is one of many examples of faithful Catholic women who were killed after spurning a powerful pagan suitor. You can see her skeleton through some parts of the wax facade, such as her teeth and parts of her hand.  Her body now lies in the only completed structure designed by the Baroque architect Carlo Maderno.

However, when chiseling away at the rock face, sculptor Gutzon Borglum had a lot more in mind than is immediately apparent.Borglum’s initial plan was to sculpt the outline of the Louisiana Purchase and inscribe it with the most important events between George Washington’s and Teddy Roosevelt’s presidencies. When that fell through, Borglum started in on a new, equally valiant endeavor. He wanted to create a Hall of Records to house important American documents for posterity.This grand time capsule was to be 80 feet tall and 100 feet long, lined with brass cabinets containing copies of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and other historic American contributions to art, science, and industry. The hall would be carved into the canyon behind the heads, and would be accessible via an 800-foot staircase.Work began in 1938 with workers blasting a 70-foot-long cavern using dynamite. The government was wary of the ambitious project, and insisted that Borglum finish the heads before he continued working on the Hall of Records. But Borglum died unexpectedly in 1941, and though his son put the finishing touches on the sculptural portraits (originally intended to depict the presidents to their waists), the Hall of Records project was abandoned.The unfinished hall sat empty and untouched for decades. Then in 1998, 16 porcelain panels were placed inside the chamber. They describe the construction of the Mount Rushmore Memorial and why those presidents were chosen, and document a history of the United States. These are intended not for the general public, but as a time capsule for people of the distant future, as the sculptor intended.The panels are sealed inside a teak box inside a titanium vault, covered by a 1,200-pound granite slab carved with a quote from Borglum’s original plans: “…let us place there, carved high, as close to heaven as we can, the words of our leaders, their faces, to show posterity what manner of men they were. Then breathe a prayer that these records will endure until the wind and rain alone shall wear them away.”As for Borglum’s initial plan of an inscribed Louisiana Purchase sculpture, it was met with several obstacles. First, at the scale he intended it would have been impossible to sculpt the descriptions large enough for anyone to read. Second, Borglum had measured incorrectly when planning out the presidential heads (which is why Jefferson peeks out from behind Washington’s shoulder), and so Lincoln had to be pushed over to where the Louisiana Purchase was supposed to go.","Hidden behind Lincoln's head is a 70-foot-long chamber containing enamel plates documenting American history, sealed in a teakwood box in a titanium vault. ","Black Elk Peak,Cosmos Mystery Area,Crazy Horse Memorial","Behind Lincoln's head to the right Mount Rushmore National Memorial Keystone, South Dakota",43.8791,-103.4591,DylanMolly McBride JacobsonNate42,2017-01-30 00:00:00,"Cosmos Mystery Area,Black Elk Peak,Crazy Horse Memorial,Chapel In The Hills","Penshaw Monument,José Martí Bust on Pico Turquino,Paper Airplane Trail ,The Light of Truth Ida B.

More than 100 locomotives and train cars rot away, some in deteriorating depots, others out in the field. Among these are some very rare train engines, and a few cars that are said to have transported prisoners to Auschwitz during the Holocaust.Built at the beginning of the 20th century as a repair yard for the national railway, only a few southern parts of the train yard are still in use, while most of it is abandoned.Two large depots, a few smaller sheds and open-air areas are scattered with locomotives and railcars, some of them very ancient, others more recent, from Hungary’s time as part of the Soviet Regime. Some of the trains were brought here to be repaired and exhibited in the Budapest Railway Museum but never made it to the display and were instead left behind in the train yard.There are a few gems rusting away in the graveyard that are sure to make any train enthusiast’s heart beat faster. A few Hungarian MAV 424 steam engines weigh in at 137 tons and bear a red star on their fronts, which earned the train yard its nickname. There is also an engine of the MAV 301 series, used from 1911 to 1914, which is one of only a few still in existence.Linked to this engine are several German freight cars, which may be the very ones that transported hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to their death in Auschwitz during Nazi occupation in World War II. Standing in front of the freight cars, one can only imagine the horror, tragedy, and despair that went on inside of them.Among the more recent items in the train graveyard are some engines and cars from the Soviet era, inside of which rail tickets from the 1960s can still be found.

1017,Bellows Falls Petroglyphs,"rocks,ancient,archaeology,geology",169,860,"On the bedrock wall at the base of the Great Falls in Vermont, is a prehistoric petroglyph site.Bellows Falls is home to two clusters of petroglyphs, located about 50 feet south of the Vilas Bridge, which crosses the Connecticut River. The mysterious carvings depict rounded heads with rough, minimalist features - eyes, mouths. Several of the heads have protuberances that look like horns or antennae, and may depict feathers worn as hair decorations. Various hypotheses place them at anywhere from 300-3,000 years old.The first white person to write about the carvings at Bellows Falls was  researcher David McClure in 1789, who noted that “the figures have the appearance of great antiquity” and ascribed them to the native people of the area - the Abenaki. McClure thought that the etchings marked the presence of evil spirits. In 1807-1808, Edward Augustus Kendall, a writer and antiquarian,  speculated that the carvings were doodles of sorts, made while Abenaki fishers harvested the abundance of fish that could be found at the base of the falls. This theory stuck for generations. Of course, nobody thought to ask the local Abenaki people.Throughout the 19th century, white men wrote and sketched descriptions of the stone carvings, portraying something very different than what is seen there today. Did the roiling waters of the falls erode the carvings? Did the men make stuff up? We do know that in 1930 or 1931,  a local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution hired a professional stone carver to “recarve” the figures, which had become faint. In 1961, the faces were also painted bright yellow, so they could be seen better. Neither of these acts was a fantastic move historical-preservation-wise, as it made dating and identifying the petroglyphs even more difficult. Further, they were destructive, disrespectful acts at a site that remains important to some Abenaki people.How closely do the figures seen at the site today resemble the figures that were chipped into the rock by Abenaki people before European settlers arrived in Vermont? This is one of the many mysteries of these petroglyphs.The westward orientation of the carvings may hint at the meaning of the carvings. In Abenaki folklore, a dead person’s soul travels westward when it leaves the body. These faces may have been waymarkers, pointing the way to the afterlife. Adding to this theory, an Abenaki burial ground was found not too far from the site. But no one really knows.",These mysterious petroglyphs in Vermont reflect a troubled history in the treatment of Native American culture. ,"Dummerston Vine,Santa's Land,The Nature Museum Feejee Mermaid","Bellows Falls, Vermont, 05478 United States 43.1353, -72.4403NearbySanta's Land8.76 milesThe Nature Museum Feejee Mermaid8.92 milesDummerston Vine15.45 miles",43.1353,-72.4403,cehgraynaturetackmpbodinamytinagerohanae1savagemmpbodinjjaydegregorionnaturetacke1savageaamytinagerohana,2015-10-16 00:00:00,"Santa's Land,The Nature Museum Feejee Mermaid,Dummerston Vine,Parrish Shoes Sign","Église Notre-Dame de Vals (Church of Our Lady of Vals),Seminole Canyon,Boca de Potrerillos,Tiermes",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bellows-falls-petroglyphs

Fuji.Once the springs are reached, kuro-tamago, or black eggs, can be purchased five at a time. The eggs are ordinary chicken eggs but the shell turns black due to being boiled in the hot sulfur spring. Local tradition holds that for each black egg eaten, seven years is added to one’s life. However, some say that eating more than two is not recommended.The valley is sometimes referred to as “The Death Valley” by locals. Some 3000 years ago Mount Hakone erupted leaving the hot spring filled crater. All along the path to the egg vendor are active sulfuric geysers, which can be hazardous at times.

1020,Clock Tower Building,"astounding timepieces,architectural oddities,architecture",206,859,"Opened in 1898, the Clock Tower Building was one of the many gilded wonders created in Manhattan by the architectural team of McKim, Mead & White. It was capped, as the name suggests, with a beautiful mechanical clock, the city’s largest, with “more than a dozen gears, ranging in diameter from a half inch to two feet…attached to a hammer that hourly strikes a 5,000-pound bronze bell.”The home office of New York Life Insurance Company until they moved uptown in 1927 to their new headquarters in Madison Square, the building housed other offices until it was purchased by New York City in 1967 for use by various municipal agencies and courts. But by the 1970s the clock tower itself, if not the building, had been long abandoned in that peculiar New York habit of forgetting its architectural treasures. The clock itself had stopped working, the glass was broken, and the clock tower had been left to molder.In 1972 the space just below the clock—originally planned as architect Stanford White’s entertaining room, before he was murdered for “entertaining” the murderer’s wife—was turned into the Clocktower Gallery, part of alternative space movement leader Alanna Heiss’s efforts to find new unusual art spaces in New York City. The now legendary Clocktower Gallery brought artists in close contact with the clock, and many incorporated it into their art, including one artist who hung naked from the clock and bathed himself with a hose. Later, the gallery would also become the broadcast center for an art-focused internet radio station.Happily, the old clock found new life in 1979 when municipal workers Marvin Schneider, Eric Reiner, and George Whaley convinced the city to let them repair it. Despite having little in the way of horological experience, they succeeded and today Schneider is the city’s clockmaster—the first in many decades. Every Wednesday morning, Schneider would make a house call to the Clock Tower Building and hoist two 800-pound weights whose slow descent would power the clock for the week. Visitors to the art gallery could climb a spiral staircase to view the workings of the now perfectly-operating timepiece.Unfortunately, like so many other New York City attractions, after 9/11 the city-owned clock tower was made off-limits to visitors. Even more unfortunate, the Clocktower Gallery was forced to close in 2013 when the city decided to sell the building to developers.Today, the Clock Tower Building is surrounded by scaffolding as a five-year condominium conversion finally nears completion. Preservationists were horrified in 2015 when they learned that the developers intended to electrify the 19th century clock and turn the clock tower, a designated interior landmark, into a triplex penthouse (thus forever cutting off its access to the public). After a two-year legal battle, a court ruled in favor of the preservationists and the penthouse plans were scrapped.If you’ve got a few million dollars to spare, you can now purchase your very own apartment in the spectacular Clock Tower Building. And maybe, just maybe, the clock tower itself will someday once again be open to visitors. In the meantime, admire the Gilded Age wonder as you pass by on Broadway and see if you can catch a glimpse of that wonderful clock 13 stories up.","A historic 1890s architectural masterpiece with an iconic clock tower that, once open to the public, now faces an uncertain future. ","Mmuseumm,African Burial Ground National Monument,The Mulberry Bend","125 Worth St New York, New York, 10013 United States",40.7157,-74.0025,hrnickmbisondlc31723cait7911Zia Ahasan,2009-09-18 00:00:00,"Mmuseumm,African Burial Ground National Monument,The Mulberry Bend,Farm.One","The Temple of Abu Simbel,Jantar Mantar,Prague Astronomical Clock ,St. Mark's Clock Tower (Torre dell'Orologio)",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/clocktower-gallery

However, the name of the forest does not derive from its seeming isolation; the place is titled because it sits on the remains of a failed housing development built in the early part of the 20th century.In the 1920s, as Madison, Wisconsin’s bought-and-created capital city, was quickly growing, developers sought to cash in on modern housing developments. The Lake Forest Land Company made plans to build an attractive new neighborhood on the south side of Lake Wingra. Although concrete foundations were laid and roads and sidewalks delineated, no one ever managed to live there. The marshy land proved too unstable and began to suck down the foundations. Then when the economic downturn of the Great Depression hit, it sealed the fate of the area: the company went bankrupt, and the plans for the housing development were scrapped.Take advantage of the free admission to the arboretum and wander down through this forest; imagine what it would have been like and enjoy the ghosts of the houses that should have occupied the area.

When the estate’s property was divided and sold off in the 1800s, 20 wooden houses designed by Gilbert R. Robinson, Jr. were built along the drive in 1882 and rented to laborers and working class civil servants.After World War II, aluminum and asphalt became an exterior home decorating fad, and the vintage façades of the rowhouses were covered in shiny gray metal. By the 1960s, the houses were in shambles, the overhangs were removed, the street was paved over, and many of the detail-oriented charms of the place were seemingly gone forever. In 1970, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Sylvan Terrace and the surrounding neighborhood as a historic district and the houses were renovated as part of a federal community development funding program. Unsatisfied with the work and upkeep, Sylvan Terrace residents took home improvement into their own hands.The houses are now painted in similar shades of yellow, with green shutters and brown windowsills, to preserve uniformity. The doorways vary in height, giving the terrace a quirky look.

Although its colors faded, it was painted with green, red, and yellow primary colors.After falling into neglect, the sand pit disappeared and the observation deck was closed in the early 1990s.

They are the bronze statues of the “Mallard” family, from the 1941 classic children’s book Make Way For Ducklings, and they have been a family favorite in the park since their installation in 1987. In the book, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard come to Boston to look for a home, and are excited by the beautiful Public Garden.

Instead, you may choose from a variety of endangered animals, many of which are zoo residents, as well as some common native creatures such as the skunk, a frequent night visitor to the zoo grounds. While there are a handful of specialty horses, such as the pink ribboned “princess pony”, you are forced to make the harrowing decision of choosing between a komodo dragon or a silverback gorilla, poison dart frog or a honey bee, double-wattled cassowary or peninsular pronghorn. If riding these bobbing peculiarities in a circle is a little rich for your blood and you’re the chariot type, you can nestle between the dung beetles, keeping your feet on the ground.The major donors behind this new attraction – named after Tom Mankiewicz, a screenwriter and former Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association chairman – are A&M Records cofounder Jerry Moss and his wife Ann Moss, who added their own special touch to the carousel. Instead of calliope music, they created a soundtrack including tracks by the Go-Go’s, the Police, Captain & Tennille, and other artists from the A&M catalogue. Ann Moss also had a hand in designing the animals, insisting that they all had friendly, welcoming faces, including the mystical unicorn to remind us that imagination is also in desperate need of some conservation efforts.","A carousel trades in its classic horses and calliope for endangered species, native flora and fauna, and a modern soundtrack. ","Los Angeles Zoo Botanical Gardens,Reggie The Alligator,Autry National Center ","Unnamed Road Los Angeles, California, 90027 United States",34.1473,-118.2888,RachelAvoiding RegretMartinclaytondeweyhrnick,2012-01-26 00:00:00,"Reggie The Alligator,Los Angeles Zoo Botanical Gardens,Autry National Center ,Griffith J.

In 1930, Arthur Gagner built the milk bottle next to his store to sell his homemade ice cream. Gagner built the structure entirely of wood, and while these days people are now quite used to this kind of novelty architecture, at that time it was one of the first.Gagner sold his giant bottle in 1943. By that time the shape of milk bottles had already changed to a square squat style bottle, dating the large bottle, and by the 1960s, like glass milk bottles themselves, the bottle was abandoned. It stood empty and neglected for a decade when H.P. Hood and Sons, Inc. a dairy company, was persuaded to buy it and give it to Boston Children’s Museum in 1977.Shipped to Boston by ferry on the “Great Bottle Sail” the bottle has called the Boston Children home for the last thirty years. Now sporting the phrase “It’s Hoods be Good.” it is an ice cream stand – Gagner would have been proud – and snack bar during the summer and there are tables nearby where you can sit and relax. Occasionally movies are projected onto the large white bottles side. At 40ft tall and 18ft in diameter it would take an estimated 58,620 gallons of dairy product to fill the monster milk bottle.The top half of the bottle was recently cut off and preserved, so that the bottom of the 15,000 pound bottle could be moved and restored.

1029,Cathedral of Learning ,"universities,architectural oddities,architecture",1432,857,"Towering above the University of Pittsburgh campus, the grandly named Cathedral of Learning is a masterpiece of neo-gothic architecture that holds 29 different rooms distinctly themed to different countries, and most of which still operate as classrooms. Dedicated in 1937, the sky-scraping educational institution was devised to alleviate overcrowding at the university by building vertically instead of continuing to sprawl. Instead of constructing a utilitarian behemoth, the design of the building was given over to one of the preeminent Gothic architects of the time who then essentially created Pittsburgh’s own Hogwarts. Possibly the most incredible of the original features was the massive “Common Room” which rises up three stories to sweeping stone arches. When the building was completed, it was the tallest building in Pittsburgh at the time and to this day it continues to be the tallest university building in the Western Hemisphere. While the building was under construction, the head of the university wanted to involve the community as much as possible so he devised the Nationality Rooms program. The idea behind the program was that each of the influential nationalities which contributed to the founding and growth of Pittsburgh could decorate their own room in the cathedral using the traditional style of their native region. Each country was responsible for the initial design and costs and a number of the entrants received funding, decorations, and artifacts from their native governments. In the end 29 different rooms were created by by groups representing everywhere from China to Lithuania to Russia.To this day all but two of the Nationality Rooms are still in use as active classrooms, but have not been changed since their creation giving a distinctly old world feel to each one that fits the overall feel of the Cathedral of Learning perfectly. Frank Lloyd Wright was not impressed with the Cathedral of Learning. He was quoted by the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph newspaper as saying, “That’s the most stupendous ‘keep-off-the-grass’ sign I’ve ever seen.” Pitt students don’t read it that way.

1030,Secret - Abandoned Brothel,"ghost towns,outsider architecture,abandoned,ruins",41,859,"Tucked into the sunburned sagebrush of the high desert in Lassen County, California, is an area once known as Secret Valley.The times have changed since it had that name, and everything else has changed with it - including the once bustling and rowdy railroad town turned lumber town, turned ghost town which has been all but swallowed by the desert that surrounds it. In the middle of this barren land, a few miles off the beaten path, stand the ruins of a grand and sprawling Manor House, known only as ‘Secret’ by the locals who remain. As you travel through the back roads of the dry desert, hop over a few fences and wander down a gravel road that at one time was the highway, the blazing heat and the parched earth gives way to a startlingly lush oasis of water-drenched trees swinging in the breeze that bring shade to a large house, various hitching posts and ramshackle buildings and barns. If you explore these outbuildings, you will find that some are still full of intriguing tools, metal bits & rotting horse tack. The overgrown weeds and tall green grasses everywhere hide the wooden corpses of the stage coaches & buggies that carried the huge house to this current and final location. Legend has it that Secret was a house of ill repute originally located near the railroad tracks that gave the rail workers of the late 1800s a place to fulfill their fantasies while they dreamt of finding gold in the hills or retiring rich with a beauty by their side. As the railroad declined with the advent of highways and the lumber trade, the house was relocated by buggy and coach to rest alongside the newer gravel highway, offering the same rest and respite to weary travelers and lonely locals alike for a few more years. Over time, the gravel road was rendered obsolete by the concrete highways of the new age and suddenly Secret found itself cut off and isolated - separated from the new thoroughfare by acres of grassland and marsh with no easy access to the manor or the women within it. This once glorious lodge has disintegrated through the years and though you can still see the luxury of what it was long ago, all that is left now is a haunted and rickety shell of an abandoned ranch house that remains full of the ghosts of its rumored past. The house is littered with old and filthy mattresses in almost every room, along with pieces of dismantled headboards , peeling wallpaper, rotting furniture and broken china. It has been picked clean of any worth over the years and is dangerously decrepit. Adding insult to injury, a few years ago a large tree on the property crashed through its roof, further exposing it to the elements and accelerating its decay. Despite all the mishaps, animal droppings, dusty cobwebs and years of neglect, when you are standing within the home or in its shadow, it’s easy to imagine the spirits of the inviting women who once leaned out of its many windows and doors, tempting the travelers who happened by. In the fields you can almost glimpse the horses tied to the hitching posts and in the whispers of the unlikely trees, you can hear the echoes of the many bawdy nights full of hard liquor, rowdy men and loose women. The hidden ruins of this manor in the middle of nowhere remind us that time will march on no matter what and with every step of progress, something somewhere falls behind. It is a window into an era gone by and as you stand in the shade of the trees and explore the land or the house, the imagination can’t help but wonder how many stories remain Secret to this day.The land is owned by the United States department of defense. ","Secret Manor, a house full of legends, the least of which is the haunting of long-deceased ladies of pleasure. ","Eagle Lake,Bizz Johnson National Recreation Trail,Sierra Army Depot","Litchfield, California, 96117 United States 40.5838, -120.2502NearbySierra Army Depot27.09 milesEagle Lake27.29 milesBizz Johnson National Recreation Trail30.33 miles",40.5838,-120.2502,RachelShannon OhaireBlindcolourjamescobb211msjohnnadelosreyes,2013-06-27 00:00:00,"Sierra Army Depot,Eagle Lake,Bizz Johnson National Recreation Trail,Planet X Pottery","Warm Springs Ghost Town,Perlora Ciudad de Vacaciones (Vacation City),Conata,Borgo Amerigo Fazio",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/secret-abandoned-brothel
1031,William Ricketts Sanctuary,outsider art,251,857,"A mere hour from Melbourne, in the Dandenong Ranges, one finds a landscape of huge pine trees and beautiful fern gullies. In one of such gullies, a man’s life-work and dreams live on.Born in 1898, William Ricketts began developing his skill in clay modeling in his teen years. In the 1930s he purchased a four-acre plot of land on Mount Dandenong, naming it ‘Potter’s Sanctuary’.Beginning in 1934, William Ricketts started work on his clay figures that would soon adorn all of his property. In the 1960s, after having gained some local notoriety for his sculptures, the Victorian Government bought the sanctuary and some surrounding land to become a park for public use. He continued to live on and work in his Sanctuary until 1993 when he passed away.Between 1949 and 1960, Rickett traveled often into the desert interior of Central Australia. It was here that he spent time with both Arrente and Pitjantjatjara indigenous people. These native peoples not only inspired his work as models but influenced his philosophy as well. Rickett is known for his belief that all humans should be stewards of the land, just as the indigenous people he spent time with were.The goal of his life-long project was to provide a relaxing setting where one could reflect on man’s oft forgotten connection to nature. Nestled in a glade covered in fern and mountain ash trees, William Ricketts’ masterpiece feels alive.

As other producers turn to automated labor, it is one of the last of its kind, and it’s in trouble—but not because its cookies aren’t delicious.With their rent quadrupling over the past three years, the Chang family, who has run the operation since 1962, has come up with new ways to make do. They’ve opened up the factory to allow visitors to see how the cookies are made, a process whereby the hot, flat, baked cookies are peeled off a press and must be folded and bent within seconds, lest they harden and shatter before taking their final form.While the classic fortune cookie recipe is beloved and secret (even co-owner Kevin Chang doesn’t know his mother’s recipe), the Changs have begun selling a wider variety of flavors as well, including strawberry, chocolate, and tea. With only three staff members, the factory is able to crank out up to 10,000 cookies a day. Their impressive output, however, pales in comparison to the production of automated factories, which can bake and bend around one million cookies per day.While the “old-school” techniques hinder the company’s productivity, holding to tradition is a matter of principle for Kevin Chang. As he told the BBC, “I want people to see how the cookies are made.”",One of the oldest producers of hand-folded fortune cookies still uses its original secret recipe. ,"Hang Ah Tea Room,Li Po Cocktail Lounge,Short Story Vending Machine","56 Ross Alley San Francisco, California, 94108 United States",37.7957,-122.4073,lukefater,2019-10-14 00:00:00,"Li Po Cocktail Lounge,Short Story Vending Machine,Hang Ah Tea Room,Beat Museum","Kennedy Biscuit Lofts,Printen Museum,Lečtarski Museum,Fábrica La Aurora",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/golden-gate-fortune-cookie-company
1033,Gates of Hell Sculpture,"collections,statues",587,1028,"“The Gates of Hell” is a massive sculpture work created by the French artist Auguste Rodin. The imagery of the sculpture is based on a scene from Dante’s The Inferno and the gates stand roughly six meters high and four meters wide.Of the 180 figures in the sculpture, many were later cast into separate effigies, and some are well known on their own. The most famous of these is “The Thinker,” the well-known image of the contemplative man seated and resting his chin in his palm.The sculpture was commissioned in 1880 and was originally to be completed in five years, but Rodin worked on “The Gates of Hell” for some 37 years until his death in 1917. Rodin labored on his sculpture on the ground floor of the Hotel Biron, which, a few years after his death, opened up as Musée Rodin, displaying “The Gates of Hell” and his other works.This exquisite piece of sculptural art has had a few casts made of it, but only six copies exist including the one in Musée Rodin in Paris. This one is on the Stanford University campus in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden. The garden has 200 works by Rodin, most of which are cast in bronze, though the university has others in wax and terra cotta.Be sure to check around the back for the Back Door to Hell, a small maintenance door at the back of the freestanding wall, through which you can check out some of the internal construction of this massive bronze monument. ","Rodin's famous depiction of Dante's 'Inferno', amidst a sculpture garden of many of his other works. ","Arizona Cactus Garden,Stanford Mausoleum,Pneumatic Tube System at Stanford University Hospital","Lomita Drive at Museum Way Palo Alto, California, 94304 United States",37.4329,-122.1702,ClintonMartinJames RiccipatrikdRachelAbstergailAbstergailffrncbppatrikdJames RicciMMartinRachelmmbison,2013-07-02 00:00:00,"Arizona Cactus Garden,Stanford Mausoleum,Pneumatic Tube System at Stanford University Hospital,Dymaxion Chronofile","DEVIL-ish Little Things Museum,The Sanctuary Museum,Buddha Dordenma Statue,A Sky Full of Gods and Buddhas",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gates-hell

On top of that hill sits an extensive blueberry field and a crumbling, mysterious arrangement of stones.No one knows for certain where the stones on top of Burnt Hill came from. There are 21 of them, some weighing as much as 500 pounds, all jammed into the northern side of the mound’s bedrock. Researchers first hypothesized that the rocks were erected by a 19th-century farmer as property markers, but it appears that they are many hundreds of years older. The hill may have been used as an early observatory, as the stones appear to point to the surrounding mountains in a manner that could conceivably align with sunrise, sunset, and other planetary motions. They may have been mounted by Native American tribes, but even that remains uncertain.A favorite (unconfirmed) local legend about the stones is that H.P. Lovecraft drew inspiration from them in modelling the Sentinel Hill of his famous story “The Dunwich Horror.” The opening chapter of the tale includes a reference to “great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops […] more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers.” Whether or not Lovecraft wandered among the blueberry fields atop Burnt Hill, one detail is indisputable.

This is all thanks to Bob Cassilly, a local artist best known for his renegade urban jungle-gym The City Museum, who sculpted these family-friendly stone creatures in the late ’90s.Rather than swings or slides, the park consists solely of concrete reptiles, far larger than their real life counterparts. Kids and (limber) adults alike can climb and frolic to their heart’s content in this odd sculpture garden beside a busy Midwestern thoroughfare. The sculptures themselves consist primarily of turtles, as the name would suggest, and one long snake, its body configured into an archway to provide the entrance to the park. The species represented are local to the area. Snapping turtles and box turtles are part of the park, and baby turtles hatching from their eggs provide themed seating.The park underwent a somewhat controversial transition in 2007, when construction on Highway 40 was taking place. The city had scheduled the overpass adjacent to the park for implosion. A few days before the demolition of the highway bridge, a thief stole into the park with concrete cutters and decapitated the great snake. After a few days of confusion and mystery surrounding the headless sculpture, the culprit was revealed.The “thief” was none other than Cassilly himself, apparently displeased with the notion that his creations, particularly his snake (at the time poised as if taking a bite out of the overpass scheduled for demolition), would be at risk of damage. The artist, convinced that only he had the right to destroy his sculptures, took matters into his own hands.

Fighting and rioting among the workers turned the simple tunnel into a violent slog that resulted in a tunnel that is abandoned and haunting to this very day. Work on the Paw Paw Tunnel began in 1836. The passage was created to allow boats and pack mule to bypass the handful of winding bends and horseshoes of the Potomac River. To build this shortcut, the contractor hired ethnically varied groups of immigrant workers who often clashed, both on the work site and off, leading to riots that destroyed entire saloons. More than anything the contentious workers slowed the project down. The tunnel was originally projected to be completed in 1838, but the final bricks were not placed in the arch until 1850.At the completion of the work, the 24-foot tall tunnel was completed. The canal space was so tight that only one boat at a time could pass through, and the wooden walkway hanging over it had the same issues of space except with mules that wouldn’t be able to pass each other. The tunnel was over 3,000 feet long, and dark in its depths. To keep spirits high, workers used to whistle and sing during their passage.The tunnel was eventually abandoned but remains to this day.

1043,New Mexico Mystery Stone,relics and reliquaries,89,856,"The Mystery Stone, also known as the Decalogue Stone, is located on a mountain in the remote desert of West-Central New Mexico. The stone face bears an inscription written in what some believe to be an extinct language, alternately identified as a form of Paleo-Hebrew or as Cypriotic Greek.The stone was first acknowledged in literature in 1933 by famous New Mexico archaeologist Frank Hibben, who wrote of encountering the stone on a guided tour by an individual who claimed to have first discovered the stone in the 1880’s. The inscription’s alleged existence in the late 1800’s would place the inscribing before the modern scientific rediscovery of both Paleo-Hebrew and Cypriotic Greek. However, the inscription may well be Phoenician, a script well known at the time.Proponents of the inscription being in Paleo-Hebrew claim that it is a record of the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments, based on a 1949 translation by Harvard scholar Robert Pfeiffer. In 1979, a University of New Mexico epigrapher named Dixie Perkins put forth the theory of the inscription as Cypriotic Greek, used around 500 BC in the Mediterranean region. In Perkins’ translation, the stone reads as a report from an explorer or warrior named Zakyneros, who has become isolated in the wilderness and now struggles to survive.Many others however, believe the stone to be a hoax perpetrated by Hibben himself, much of whose work has been shown to have been fabricated to show support for the idea of ancient pre-Colombian contact, and even for pre-Clovis peoples in North America. A number of the other people involved in dating and examining the stone also have connections to academically questionable figures such as Barry Feel, another proponent of ancient pre-Columbian contact theories, thus calling much of the examination of the stone into question.The stone can be accessed via a short hike from the highway.

These prolific artisans built an incredibly realistic model of all five boroughs in New York City at a scale of one inch to 100 feet. (To get a sense of the scale, the model’s version of the 1,454-foot Empire State Building measures just shy of 15 inches tall.) The entire panorama covers an area of 9,335 square feet.When introduced in 1964, the panorama’s features included lighting that cycled from dawn to dusk to night. Phosphorescent paint was added to windows on many of the model buildings, so that they would cast a realistic glow during the nighttime portion of the cycle. Thousands of colored lights highlighted municipal buildings like schools, courthouses, libraries, firehouses, police precincts, and more. Every few minutes, model airplanes took off and landed at a miniature LaGuardia Airport.Over time, slight changes to this miniature city have been made in order to preserve its architectural integrity. In 1992 the model was removed from the museum and brought up to date over the course of two years. Each of the 273 sections that make up the model was painstakingly updated using maps aerial photos, and in-person visits to ensure accuracy. More than 60,000 buildings were replaced over the course of this update.

Strays were crawling all over the island, begging for food from residents and tourists. Viewing them as pests, residents took to trapping and killing the cats. So a volunteer program was started to catch the feral felines, neuter them, and release them back to the wild.

Tours include the “Motown Suite,” with rooms furnished just as they were in the 1960s, including some midcentury decor that would be right at home on the set of Mad Men. United is also still a working record press today, with a large factory full of old, very loud, machines. Under both the Southern Plastic and United Record Pressing names, the company has manufactured vinyl for scores of artists, including Motown’s Steve Wonder and Michael Jackson, as well as Bob Dylan, Loretta Lynn, Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, The Roots, Radiohead…  the list is endless. It also held the contract to press records for the Vee-Jay label, a major blues and R&B company in Chicago, who had the foresight to release the first Beatles record in the U.S. That was before Capitol Records woke up and saw the light.",When Motown musicians came to Nashville in the 1960s they stayed at this historic record-pressing company because hotels wouldn't host them. ,"Edgehill Polar Bears,8th Avenue Reservoir,Hatch Show Print","453 Chestnut St Nashville, Tennessee, 37203 United States",36.1431,-86.7699,michelleMandrewPatinkinRaven Traveler,2017-01-30 00:00:00,"8th Avenue Reservoir,Edgehill Polar Bears,Hatch Show Print,Bridgestone Arena Smilodon Bones","Andrew Young Crossing,Site of the Woolworth Lunch Counter Sit-in,San Juan Sound ,America's Black Holocaust Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/united-record-pressing

So hot, it kept disappearing — and the Colorado Department of Transportation got tired of replacing it.The solution came with some out-of-the-DOT-box thinking: They shifted the spot by a hundredth of a mile, and turned Mile 420 into Mile 419.99.There has been less sign thievery since the switch, but it hasn’t been a complete success. The Mile 419.99 sign has gone missing a few times too, but despite the occasional sticky green fingers the spot has become a destination. For some it’s just to see if the sign is for real, for others to maybe grab a few selfies.

The building was originally a Dominican convent during which time the vault served alternately as a coal and wine cellar. In the 1890s, the building was converted to a primary school, and the vault became the baths for the students. It would take another half century before a sauna was built and the bath was opened to the public.The bath is still old fashioned in many ways, with its architecture and interior unchanged since it was first built. It consists of just one shallow pool and a number of tiny tubs where visitors can sit and relax.Throughout the years, Storkyrkobadet has become a popular meeting point for the gay community, probably because of the separate opening hours for men and women. Sweden’s most famous gay couple, Jonas Gardell and Mark Levengood, met here in the 1980s.Despite its popularity and history, Storkyrkobadet’s existence is in danger. The city planned to close it in the ’80s but thanks to a volunteer organization called Föreningen De Glada Badarnait (“Society of Merry Bathers”) it was able to live on—at least for another few decades.

As time passed, however, and cars became commonplace, the island stood its ground, eventually becoming the United States’ only remaining city with such a ban in effect.Today the island’s population of about 500 permanent residents and an additional 14,500 or so seasonal visitors gets around almost exclusively by foot, bicycle, or horse. In addition to cars, the automobile ban applies to vehicles such as scooters, ATVs, and golf carts, though exceptions are made for motorized wheelchairs, emergency vehicles, and, during the winter, snowmobiles. The island is home to Lake Shore Boulevard (M-185), which traverses eight miles of Mackinac’s picturesque shoreline and is the only state highway in the United States where cars are banned.The continued enforcement of Mackinac’s automobile ban seems fitting when one considers this resort island’s quaint charm and extensive preservation efforts. The entire 3.8 square-mile island is a designated National Historic Landmark and over 80 percent is preserved as Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can enjoy Mackinac’s natural scenic beauty through over 70 miles of hiking and biking trails.  Attractions such as Fort Mackinac, Colonial Michilmackinac, and Historic Downtown showcase the island’s historical significance and original architecture. Another notable landmark is the Grand Hotel, which has hosted five U.S. presidents, several visiting dignitaries, and cultural icons such as Mark Twain and Thomas Edison, who conducted the first public demonstration of the phonograph on the hotel’s famous 660-foot porch . ",Island where motor vehicles are banned -- home to the only carless highway in the United States. ,"Skull Cave,The Mackinac Bridge,The Wacky Taxidermy & Miniatures Museum","Mackinac Island, Michigan, 49757 United States 45.8681, -84.6289Book a hotel on Kayak Visit Website NearbySkull Cave0.71 milesThe Mackinac Bridge5.94 milesThe Wacky Taxidermy & Miniatures Museum7.66 miles",45.8681,-84.6289,Leslie McIntyreMichael Bareraarteek001heleenschilderjilleee2002paigeelizabeth3660hheleenschilderddlappicoMichael Bareraccesarepaigeelizabeth3660eeljojoejjilleee2002arteek001lltellor42Rachel,2012-07-23 00:00:00,"Skull Cave,The Mackinac Bridge,The Wacky Taxidermy & Miniatures Museum,Jack Pine Lumberjack Shows","Ellesmere Island,Machrie Moor Standing Stones,Lofoten Islands,Popeye Village",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mackinac-island

Mercer, the Mercer Caverns have been a popular destination for the cave-curious public. The longest continually running commercial cave in the state of California, the cave has guest books signed by a hundred and twenty years of visitors.Victorian visitors to the cave originally descended on ropes – now there are stairs – to view the three-million-year-old caves via candlelight. From a Victorian brochure: “Visitors should wear clothes which they never expect to wear to a wedding afterward. A candle is to be carried in one hand and it is prudent to have a supply of matches in one’s pocket.” What they probably weren’t told is that they had entered an ancient burial ground.The cave was originally used by a prehistoric Indian Tribe called the Yokuts as a mortuary cave. They would bring bodies to the opening and let them roll down inside. Because such a site was sacred, no one was allowed to enter. The Yokuts were hunters and when the game was gone they moved camp. Over the years, the entrance filled with dirt, leaves and rocks and was completely lost.When Walter J. Mercer first broke through the dirt and climbed down into the cave he found the remains of four adults, one child, and one infant, and even took a bone as a souvenir. Mercer even named the caves the New Calaveras Cave or “new skull cave” after the skeletons he found within. However, in its conversion to a show cave little was said of the Indian remains, and after a name change to the Mercer Caverns memory of the cave’s dark history was mostly forgotten.If this left uneasy spirits behind, it seems they got their revenge. Mercer, who was working in the cave, fell thirty feet when his rope broke, and badly injured his spine, causing him great pain for the next 12 years and eventually leading to his death at the age of 46.Update as of October 2020: The caverns are closed indefinitely. Update as of May 2022: The caverns have reopened for tours from 10 am to 3:30 pm, closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Catching a glimpse of these particular horses feels like an extra special treat, as they were once destined to disappear from the land.The hundreds of horses that live within the Tonto National Forest and roam along the banks of the Salt River are technically feral, as they’re the descendants of horses the Spanish re-introduced to North America during their conquests of the New World. However, as with most of the feral horses in the United States, they’re referred to as “wild.”According to state records, the Salt River herd has been roaming the land freely since before the Tonto National Forest was designated in 1902. But though they’d been living on the land for at least a century, the horses’ fates were uncertain in the early 21st century. In 2015, the United States Forest Service issued a notice declaring the herd as “unauthorized livestock” and announced a plan to capture, remove, and auction off any unclaimed horses.The apparent end of the Salt River horses spurred local advocates into action. The Salt River Wild Horse Management Group was formed and successfully reached an agreement with the Arizona Department of Agriculture. Now, the nonprofit group manages the horses and attempts to control the population by darting the animals with a birth control vaccine.It’s possible to rent kayaks near the start of the river and paddle through their territory, which creates a high likelihood of seeing the horses in or along the river. (Please be careful not to disturb them, and take only pictures from a safe distance.)Even if you don’t catch a glimpse of any elusive equines, the river itself is beautiful, particularly early in the morning.

According to his writings, Sturluson used the naturally heated pool to bathe. Sturluson lived nearby and even had his own private tunnel that led from his home directly to the foot of the hot spring.While it is likely not how it looked in Sturluson’s time, today the pool is surrounded by a circle of flat flagstones, and a quaint stone patio that runs right up to the green burms around the hot spring. There is also a door set into the squat hill behind the pool that leads to Sturluson’s private tunnel, which can be investigated by curious visitors. Of course this door does nothing to discourage the spring’s fantastical look. The temperature of the hot spring is said to fluctuate drastically, often becoming far too hot to bath in.

One of its most intriguing features, however, had been completely forgotten until the church was gutted by German firebombs in World War II.The current building is the eighth church to occupy the site on Fleet Street, with the first most likely being built in the 6th century by Irish missionaries. A different incarnation subsequently built on the spot in the Middle Ages was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Wren was commissioned to design a replacement in 1672; the resulting church took seven years to build and ended up being one of the tallest and most expensive churches the architect ever built, second only to St. Paul’s Cathedral.The new church was built atop the remnants of the seven previous churches, including seven different crypts and two medieval charnel houses which Wren organized into one cohesive substructure. The crypts regularly welcomed new inhabitants for almost another two centuries, right up to the 1854 cholera epidemic. Faced with a growing pile of bodies and worried about spreading the disease further, Parliament ordered the closing of all London crypts. The ancient crypt beneath St. Bride’s was sealed shut and subsequently forgotten.In 1940, the Blitz inflicted severe fire damage on St. Bride’s Church, leaving little more than a smoldering shell. Once efforts to rebuild Wren’s design got underway a decade later, the crowded burial chambers below were unexpectedly rediscovered by preparatory excavations in 1953. The crypts were found to contain the remains of 227 individually identified people interred since the 17th century, as well as an estimated 7000 human remains in the more communal charnel house, where bones removed from the cemetery during the Middle Ages (in order to make room for new burials) were arranged according to type (skulls with skulls, femurs with femurs, etc.) and laid out in a checkerboard pattern to an as-yet unknown depth.St. Bride’s more recent bone cache is concerned one of the best resources for historic forensics in Europe.

This picturesque region happens to be home to the oldest Jewish cemetery in the Netherlands, Beth Haim. Beth Haim means “House of Life,” and as you will see, it is indeed full of life. The cemetery is like a lush and peaceful secret garden. Most of the tombstones are hidden in the midst of tall grass and wild bushes. The grave markers depict detailed scenes from the past that tell the stories of the people who are buried here, of their lives, their values, and their beliefs. There are about 28,000 graves at Beth Haim, many of which belong to the Sephardi Jews, whose ancestors came from Spain and Portugal. The cemetery was purchased by the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1614 and almost reached full capacity in 1923. Many famous Jewish rabbis, diplomats, and scientists are buried here, such as the parents of the Dutch philosopher Spinoza. The tombstones have inscriptions in Dutch, Portuguese, and Hebrew, and are carved with elaborate scenes containing many beautiful mystic symbols. The Rodeamentos House is where the funeral ceremonies take place. It was built in 1705 and divides the old part of the cemetery with historical monumental tombstones from the section containing relatively new graves.

1070,Coronado Heights Castle,"architectural oddities,architecture",411,849,"A mysterious Spanish coin discovered near Lindsborg, Kansas in 1881 by a local college professor led to the beginnings of the legends of a visit by Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado. A later discovery of rusty chainmail seemed to confirm the stories.Coronado is believed to have visited what is now the Kansas wilderness in the 1540s during his hunt for the fabled “Seven Cities of Gold,” also known as the “Seven Cities of Cibola.” Possibly rooted in Portuguese myth, the stories of these ancient sites of native wealth drove adventurers throughout the new world on fruitless quests for a generation.Inspired by the supposed firsthand account of a Franciscan priest in 1539, Coronado set off with hundreds of Spanish soldiers and native American guides in 1541, covering some 4,000 miles in search of the cities. Not keen to admit defeat, Coronado returned in debt but with claims that he had found one of the legendary cities, but far from the wild tales that had come before, he reported that all he found there were common native huts. Scholars have long debated just what either the friar or Coronado saw – were there ever truly “Cities of Gold” or just wild tales on the frontier? Several suggest that the friar only said what he knew people wanted to hear, and was essentially fabricating his sighting. Others believe that the stories may have a foundation in truth, long since lost.Today the site in Kansas is where Coronado may have ended his ill-fated expedition and returned to Mexico, disappointed.Looking like the remains of an old fortification, the little stone castle atop the hill at Coronado Heights Park was built under a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project in the 1930s, marking the spot where Coronado is said to have gazed over the flatlands.",Marking the spot where a conquistador gave up his search for the fabled Seven Cities of Gold. ,"Holmberg and Johnson Blacksmith & Wagonshop,The Höglund Dugout,Swedish Phone Booth","Coronado Heights Park Lindsborg, Kansas, 67456 United States",38.6134,-97.703,ellen2Martincait7911LoftonHbreaingramddarkswordddarkswordDarrell Powersccait7911LoftonHbreaingramMMartin,2013-01-13 00:00:00,"The Höglund Dugout,Swedish Phone Booth,Holmberg and Johnson Blacksmith & Wagonshop,Fitz Overalls Ghost Sign","The Japanese-Style House of Prospect Park South,Herz-Jesu-Kirche,Castillo Pittamiglio,Murtoa Stick Shed",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/coronado-heights-castle
1071,Christ Cathedral (Crystal Cathedral),"music,sacred spaces",790,849,"Christ Cathedral, formerly named the Crystal Cathedral, is an all-glass megachurch located in Garden Grove, California. Designed by architect Philip Johnson in 1977 and completed in 1980, the building earns its name for its structure and size.The church, which was built to cater to a Protestant Christian demographic, once broadcast its services on the popular televangelist show, The Hour of Power. With a weekly audience of 20-million people worldwide, Hour of Power is said to be the world’s most-watched Christian program, and has featured a strange variety of speakers and testimonies.After a bankruptcy hearing, however, the ministry sold the church to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange County.Christ Cathedral, which seats roughly 2,700 people, is 12 stories high and comprised of 10,000 rectangular, tempered glass panes. Due to the seismic activity in the area, architect Johnson built the monument to withstand an earthquake of up to 8.0 magnitude. As such, the structure consists of an intricate, lace-like web of 16,000 white trusses to which the glass panes are glued, not bolted.Though the church is considered to be one of the largest all-glass buildings in the world, it emerged from humble beginnings. In 1955, the Garden Grove Community Church, as the first ministry was called then, was held on the site of a drive-in theater. Reverend Robert A. Schuller, the church’s founder, would lead weekly outdoor services while standing on the roof of the snackbar, speaking to churchgoers seated in their automobiles.Despite being criticized for performing religious services in a “passion pit,” Schuller continued to speak from his unusual pulpit and beckoned churgoers to “come as you are in the family car.” It was there where he fell in love with the sky, and eventually made plans to build a church made entirely of glass. Thus, while the exterior of Christ Cathedral is coated in a reflective silver paint, the interior roof and walls are transparent, giving off the illusion of being outdoors.The church also has a bit of a sordid past; in 2004, the church’s former orchestra conductor, Johnnie Carl, committed suicide in the church just moments before a performance of “The Glory of Christmas” was set to begin.In order to pay off its debt, the church announced in early 2009 that it would have to sell $65 million dollars worth of its property, which also features landmarks designed by prominent architects, Richard and Dion Neutra and Richard Meier. However, this wasn’t enough for the ministry to continue to hold onto its massive church. The Roman Catholics are now working to restore the towering organ with its 16,000 pipes that soar up against the glass. ","Megachurch turned Catholic church comprised of 10,000 glass panes. ","Dominguez Palm Tree,Jack Norworth Memorial Marker,Walt Disney’s Bench","12141 Lewis St, Garden Garden Grove, California, 92840 United States",33.7873,-117.8975,anhieAvoiding RegretmbisonTaterchipsdalebest1blazinatoraacl47blazinatorTTaterchipsddalebest1Avoiding Regretmmbison,2009-10-16 00:00:00,"Jack Norworth Memorial Marker,Walt Disney’s Bench,Dominguez Palm Tree,Disneyland's Club 33","Nathaniel Dett Memorial Chapel,Robert Johnson's Grave,Robert Johnson's Headstone at Payne Chapel,Robert Johnson's Cenotaph",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crystal-cathedral

Founded in 1985, it has grown into a popular and idyllic meeting spot for visitors and locals alike.At a time when craft breweries were hard to come by in the Netherlands, founder Kasper Peterson was inspired by his experience with Belgian beer styles and, as his brewery has grown, so has its offerings and experimental nature. The ostrich-and-egg logo was also Peterson’s brainchild, as he had a particular fondness for the oversized avian species (which is fitting in respect to the brewery’s proximity to Amsterdam’s Royal Artis Zoo).The brewery’s offerings include Belgian styles such as dubbels and tripels as well as a pilsner and IPAs. As if enjoying a beer beside a windmill wasn’t enough to entice customers, the Brouwerij’t IJ also serves up puns on the sly. For most unsuspecting and uninitiated tourists, it’s easy for the wordplay to go right over your head since it delightfully deals with the letters i and j. In Dutch, IJ is the name of the river that the brewery sits on. Pronounced “eye,” this could also be used for the Dutch word for “egg,” which is actually spelled ei. Some beers on tap include the IJ Wit (or “Egg White”), the Paas IJ (“Easter Egg”), the IJndejaars (“One Year Old”), and the IJbok (“Egg Buck,” whatever that is), in addition to more standard and less playfully named brews.Continuing with its theme of avian appreciation, the brewery adopted one of the ostriches at the Artis zoo and named her Esasa, Zulu for “be happy.”","This bird-loving brewery is situated in an old municipal bathhouse, nestled beside a 300-year-old windmill. ","Mark Bischof's Studio,The Resistance Museum,Micropia","7 Funenkade Amsterdam, 1018 AL Netherlands",52.3668,4.9263,aniatbrownmidnighttravellernotoriousFIGvalerioshaunter,2019-07-23 00:00:00,"The Resistance Museum,Micropia,Mark Bischof's Studio,Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam","Brauerei Hofstetten, Bow & Arrow Brewing Co.,Taedonggang Brewing Company,The Lemp Family Tomb",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brouwerijt-ij-brewery

The resulting castle is easily one of the most stunning in all of Europe.The construction took 10 years, but by the end of it, the Romanian royals had a summer palace equipped with everything from a movie theater to a concert hall. The ornate 160-room palace was built in a Neo-Renaissance style and each room had its own identity and theme. After its inauguration in 1883, the king and his family began spending their summers in the fairytale castle, which also served as the venue for important meetings during the early months of World War I.The first couple to live there, King Carol I and his wife Queen Elizabeth of Romania were known to be very different in temperament and interests. The king was an accomplished soldier who greatly expanded and improved the Romanian military, and the queen was more artistic, with a great fondness for music, art, and literature, and even published poetry under the pen name Carmen Sylva. Peleș, too, was a reflection of these two different personalities. On one hand, there was an extensive 4,000-piece collection of weaponry from Europe and Asia on display in the Weapons Room. On the other, there was a beautifully appointed movie theater, whose walls and ceilings were decorated with frescoes by Austrian artists Gustav Klimt and Franz von Matsch. The first movie projection in Romania is reported to have taken place in this room. Other art forms were far from neglected. The Music Room contained intricate pieces of teak furniture gifted by the Indian Maharajah of Kapurtala and was used as a salon by Queen Elizabeth.King Carol’s successor, King Ferdinand built a smaller version of this grand palace right next door to it and named it Pelișor. When Romania fell under Communist rule, Peleș, along with other royal properties, were seized, and the castle was closed between 1975 and 1990. Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu had his eye on it as potential protocol residence but this plan was thwarted by the caretakers of the castle who told him that fungus was growing inside and this would be detrimental for its residents. After the revolution of 1989, it was reopened to the public as a museum. ","This elaborately decorated, fairytale-like Romanian royal palace is one of the most striking castles in Europe. ","The Mountain Sphinx ,Iulia Hasdeu Castle,Bran Castle",Aleea Peleșului 2 Sinaia Romania,45.3599,25.5427,tundeolah57twodriftersKellee KovalskyalexsimionepfromerJR WetmoreJR WetmoreCorinaIoanaCorina PredaKellee KovalskyaalexsimionovidiuneacsueepfromergingercinnamonCCretuBogdan94ttwodrifterskklaudiam,2017-05-22 00:00:00,"The Mountain Sphinx ,Bran Castle,Iulia Hasdeu Castle,Doftana Penitentiary","Frederiksborg Castle,The Canaletto Room,Richmond Castle in Kalutara,Sanquhar Castle",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peles-castle

The trees have been removed.The Holy Cross Church has been many things, however, it’s most distinctive time was when it served as a home to “The Hanging Garden.”Part of the Global Tree Project, an international art initiative that is working to affirm connections between the natural world and audiences, Shinji Turner-Yamamoto developed a site-specific installation known as the Hanging Garden in Cincinnati’s Holy Cross Church. Abandoned and deconsecrated, the 19th-century Holy Cross Church spoke to Turner-Yamamoto. With his piece, the artist explores the spiritual in nature by using the church’s nave stripped to the ribs of its vaulting.The 40-foot Hanging Garden installation features a living birch tree that is supported by a large, inverted dead birch tree. The intertwined root systems of the two birches create a suspended garden that is oriented as a cross or tower at the center of the church. Turner-Yamamoto has been creating jaw-dropping, site-specific installations for the past decade. The artist has said that by taking trees out of their normal, natural context, he hopes to invite viewed to experience nature in a more contemplative way.The church has since gone on to other uses.

I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. - Jack LondonJack London, well know as the author of Call of the Wild and lesser known as a booze hound and ladies man, died in the small town of Glen Ellen, 60 miles north of his hometown San Francisco, three years after his dream house, known as the Wolf House, caught fire and burnt down.While the ruins are known as the Wolf House, Jack and wife Charmian London lovingly called their dream house “The Big House” or “The Castle.” A big house it was; 15,000 sq ft, four stories with twenty-six rooms and nine fireplaces, and designed in a mixture of Spanish, exemplified by the terracotta tile roof, and Craftsman Styles, seen in the log cabin exterior and detailed wooden interior. The Wolf House was to become the London’s home, Jack’s workshop, Charmian’s tower, and an oversized cabinet of curiosities filled with the London’s unique collection from their world travels.Albert Farr of San Francisco designed the house and construction began in 1910. The dream home was nearly completed in August 1913 when it burnt to the ground. In 1995, a team of forensic experts concluded that the cause of the fire was likely due to a pile of oil-soaked rags, left by workers, spontaneously combusting.Jack vowed to rebuild the Wolf House, but with an insurance policy only paying out 1/8 the amount of money already poured into the project, he died three years later of kidney disease, having rebuilt very little.What’s left today are the haunting remains of the London’s dream home. The two lower stories of rock remain mostly intact, covered in moss and sprouting ferns, while the five towering chimneys built to support nine fireplaces are held up by massive steel support beams. A wooden walkway guides visitors around the ruins, keeping them safely away from the chimneys while affording beautiful views of the stone remains.Jack London State Historic Park houses the London’s collection in the Happy Halls House, which wife Charmian built after Jack’s death. Most of the furniture was custom built for use in the ill-fated Wolf House, and a corner of the house is set up to preserve Jack’s writing studio as it would have looked when he died. In this house the music of the time is played on the London’s piano by a talented volunteer and the walls are decorated with curiosities from around the world. As short walk from this house is the “Country Cottage” where they lived until Jack’s death and, if you are lucky, a docent will show you around the amazing gourmet kitchen.A short walk in the opposite direction are the graves of Jack and Charmian London.",The haunting ruins of Jack London's dream house. ,"Crane Melon Barn,The Accordion Man ,Rancho Obi-Wan","Glen Ellen, California, 95442 United States 38.3510, -122.5373Visit Website NearbyCrane Melon Barn7.94 milesThe Accordion Man 9.31 milesRancho Obi-Wan9.82 miles",38.351,-122.5373,TreChelgorothbazilicusmbisonhrnickAnnetta BlackNeighborhood SquatchChelgorothbazilicusjjustinholdstock91hrnickjjulnyesmmbisonAnnetta Black,2009-11-29 00:00:00,"Crane Melon Barn,The Accordion Man ,Rancho Obi-Wan,Location of the Microsoft Windows XP Default Wallpaper","Rafael Coronel Museum,Tullaherin Folk Museum and Round Tower,Stern of the Niantic,Nelson",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wolf-house-jack-london-state-park
1083,Chislehurst Caves,"shakespeare,tunnels,subterranean sites,caves,ecosystems",216,847,"If someone were to try and tie together every piece of English History and from the Saxons to Dr. Who, Bowie to the Druids, Air Raids to Shakespeare, to one space they could do so in two words: Chislehurst Caves. How much of it would be true, is another question all together.Despite being called caves, these 22 miles (35 km) of tunnels are something much stranger then that, a series of entirely man-made tunnels, rooms and caverns under the south eastern suburbs of Greater London, UK. Though, there is debate over how old the caverns are, it is believed by some that they go back to the time of the Saxons – the 400s and 500s A.D. – some suggest they may go back 8000 years, to 6000 B.C. just after the time when the landmass of Britain was separated from the rest of Europe in 6500 B.C.The caves information (as well as an archeologist of 1905, now generally debunked) split the tunnels into three sections. The oldest area is thought to be 6000-4000 year old and is created to the “druids,” though by this it is actually meant Neolithic Britons. (The druids were never more then a small priestly caste of mystics in Britain dating to at the earliest 100 B.C., and had nothing to do with the Neolithic monuments, such as Stonehenge, they are often associated with.)Following British history like a textbook, the next tunnels are said to be 2,000 years old and undertaken by the Romans after their arrival in Britain in 43 A.D. Other tunnels are dated from the 500s with the arrival of the Germanic Saxons.Despite all this, the earliest known mention of the tunnels dates to the much more recent 1250 A.D. and most archeologists and historians point out that no archeological evidence exists to prove these ancient claims. Spurious claims about the tunnels continue through the 1700s, placing Christopher Wren, Napoleon III and Shakespeare all in the cave at one point or another. (Once again, while plausible, no evidence exists to confirm these claims.)Regardless, the caves were definitely an active lime mine through the middle ages and were last worked in the 1830’s. As interesting as the history of the 22 miles of man-made tunnels is, the modern historical record of the tunnels is even more intriguing and unquestionably true.During WWI the caves served as a munitions storage house, but took on an even more important role in WWII, as a complete underground city. Housing some 15,000 inhabitants the caves were outfitted with lights, a hospital, a chapel and even a barbershop. A baby, Cavena Rose Wakeman, was even born within the caves. In the 1960s the caves became associated with a very different period of English culture, rock and roll. David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd all played concerts in the Chislehurst Caves.Another type of British hero can be found in these caves as well, the fictional kind. Merlin, Dr. Who. and a number of other British fantasy and science fiction shows have been filmed in the caves. It would seem, regardless of whether the Chislehurst Caves are 8000 or 800 years old, whether they had druids, or just people playing druids for TV in them, they remain, quintessentially British.","Shakespeare, David Bowie, Dr. Who, the Saxons, Druids and Romans are all claimed to have all made their mark on these massive man made tunnels. ","Severndroog Castle,The Mount,Eltham Palace","Caveside Close Chislehurst, England, BR7 5JY United Kingdom",51.4106,0.0575,mbisonSimplureerenakabaAllisonEng,2009-11-01 00:00:00,"Eltham Palace,The Mount,Severndroog Castle,Charlton House","Upton Chamber ,The Caves of Nottingham,Bufador de Peñiscola,100,000 Soldiers of Trabuc Caves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chislehurst-caves
1084,Site of the New Jersey Shark Attacks of 1916,"water,animals",220,846,"In July of 1916, New Jersey became the site of a series of vicious shark attacks that would span 12 days and take the lives of four people and severely injuring one.With previous deadly attacks in Beach Haven and Spring Lake, New Jersey, the shark made its way north and down a freshwater creek in Matawan, New Jersey on July 12, where it would attack and kill 12-year-old Lester Stillwell and 24-year-old Stanley Fisher within an hour of each other. Matawan hadn’t prepared itself for attacks like other shoreline towns in New Jersey, as they were so far inland along a freshwater creek. The suspected man-eater would be caught two days later in the nearby Raritan Bay. To be sure it was the killer, the over 300-pound monster was dissected, and 15 pounds of human remains were found in its stomach.It has been determined that the shark was a bull shark, the only shark that can survive in both fresh and saltwater.

1085,Saline Valley Hot Springs,"hot springs,martian landscapes,deserts,ecosystems,water",102,847,"In the arid Saline Valley known for its salt, borax, and abandoned mines, three springs surrounded by palm trees create a surreal, clothing optional oasis for the hardy souls who relish in the challenging pastime of hard desert camping.Some 2 1/2 to 4 hours (depending on dicey road conditions) from pavement over treacherous, rocky dirt roadways, a monster made of tractor parts and a sign with a spooky bat on it welcomes visitors to the Saline Valley Hot Springs. A satisfying reward after the bumpy journey, Saline Valley is a series of gorgeous springs, each with multiple soaking pools scattered in a line along a stretch of dirt road 3 miles long. It is possible to visit the springs on a day trip if you start early from one of the nearest towns (Bishop, Lone Pine, or Big Pine), but most visitors to the springs stay overnight.The springs weren’t unheard of during the mining heyday of Saline Valley, but it wasn’t until the 1960s that they became popular among nudists, free thinkers, and nomads who developed a semi-permanent camp. The hardy residents began taming the wild springs into several soaking pools made of concrete, rock, and tile. They built showers and dishwashing facilities, planted shaded grass areas, and dug 3 latrines—creating a makeshift vacation spot to escape to from the harsh Death Valley climate.This seasonal community population waned during the pounding heat of summer and the brutal freeze of winter, relying completely on supplies from the closest towns of Lone Pine and Big Pine. Timing was crucial, as they were often cut off from these towns by storms that made the primitive roads impassable. There were several attempts to clear out the encampment at the springs, none of them by force and none of them successful until 1994.In 1994, Saline Valley and its warm springs were annexed into Death Valley National Park. Until then the area was under the Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction. The encampment was dispersed, and visitation was limited to 30 days. The original latrines were replaced by a less crude system of concrete lines, and the area was put under the watchful eye of the National Park Service. While the wanderers that called the springs their home were all displaced, one man, named Wizard, remained. Wizard was the longest and most consistent resident of the springs and was made the permanent caretaker for the site until he passed away and Lee “Lizard” Greenwell took over his post.Today the springs are not found on any NPS maps and rangers at the station in Big Pine are reluctant to tell visitors how to find them. Despite this, the springs are lively with adventurers, helping Lizard maintain the grounds between soaks in the 107-degree water, hiking the surrounding hills, going on 4x4 adventures, and enjoying pick up soccer games in the camp.In contrast to the remote, free-thinking vibe of the area’s land, the airspace above it is part of the US military’s R-2508 Special Use Airspace complex, and low-flying jets are not an uncommon sight. Rumor has it that if campers fly an American flag from their home base, the jets will give them a little thrill with an extra low buzz over their heads. There is a makeshift landing strip near the hot springs, and various small aircraft can be enjoyed as they lift off and touch down. This is not an adventure for the ill-prepared or campers who enjoy creature comforts. The road is brutal on vehicles, dangerous, and is often washed out in many places. The climate varies from day to day and even hour to hour with extremely high and extremely low temperatures, strong winds, and the journey to the springs includes a sharp altitude drop. Do your homework before visiting this location, and be prepared and self-sufficient—this is an adventure for seasoned and prepared desert campers or those well-versed in self-sufficiency. There is still a lot of discussion going on regarding the infrastructure and community/park intervention in the area. One of the hot topics is land art, as some people think it’s part of the free-spirited culture, while others suggest to take it down.",A hard-to-reach oasis in a desolate corner of Death Valley National Park. ,"Marble Bath,The Sailing Stones of Racetrack Playa,Teakettle Junction","South Warm Springs Road Death Valley National Park Inyo County, California",36.8056,-117.7734,TreTeaAndCoffeeLoverRachel,2013-04-04 00:00:00,"Marble Bath,Teakettle Junction,The Sailing Stones of Racetrack Playa,Cerro Gordo","Don Juan Pond,Námaskarð,Frying Pan Lake,Deception Island",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/saline-valley-hot-springs-2

Tesla, Father of (insert countless groundbreaking inventions here), ended his life alone and broke at the New Yorker Hotel, in Suite 3327.These days, Suite 3327 has a plaque bearing Tesla’s name, and a second plaque honoring him graces the exterior of the hotel. Engineers, scientists, geeks, UFO enthusiasts, and other admirers all make the pilgrimage here to pay homage to the “mad” scientist who changed the world before the world was ready. Tesla spent ten years in this room, slowly losing his mind, falling in love with pigeons, and occasionally meeting with dignitaries.Besides being the place Nikola laid his head to rest for the last time on this earthly plane, the dour room on the 33rd floor is also the site of a conspiracy. Tesla kept a safe in this suite, and it’s where he stored his most controversial and important scientific papers. One of the more intriguing inventions was “Tesla’s Death Ray,” the culmination of his work on particle beams. While he had shopped the weapon unsuccessfully to several governments both as the “Death Ray” and the “Peace Ray,” he swore it could not be stolen as the blueprints were only in his head. In his words: “[The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation’s border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.”On the day after Tesla died, his nephew hurried to the New Yorker and upon arrival found that his uncle’s notebooks and several papers had been removed from Suite 3327, along with the inventor’s body. A short time later, all of his work was impounded and passed through a handful of government agencies until the War Department deemed them worthy of “Top Secret” status.Some believe he was murdered by the FBI, despite his age and health being consistent with a natural death; some think he was an alien, and he simply returned to the mothership. The rest who mourn the loss of the quirky Serbian genius feel a palpable sadness knowing that the “man who invented the 20th century” left this life mad and misunderstood, sharing his bread and honey with the pigeons, fading in a lonely New York hotel room.Taking the escalator down one floor there is a bust of Nikola, as well as a display case and several photographs pertaining to him.

1088,The Wave,"martian landscapes,geological oddities,ecosystems,geology",453,5429,"190 million years ago, one of the greatest geological formations in the world began to take shape.In the Coyote Buttes ravine, some 5,225 feet above sea level, stands Arizona’s the Wave. The Wave has a remarkable undulating appearance, with massive sandstone structures stretched like taffy and cinnamon color strata domes. It is, in a way, a geological snapshot in time, a still shot of the effect natural forces have on the environment.The Wave is comprised of Navajo Sandstone dunes that have calcified vertically and horizontally, turning into hardened, compacted rocks over time. The peculiar and unique fluctuating stratum was created by slow wind and rain erosion. The Wave remained basically unknown until the 1990s when it was largely advertised in German travel brochures and shown in the 1996 movie Faszination Natur. Small groups of Europeans visited the area, and its popularity grew; tour guides confide that it is still largely a European population that visits, though Americans have definitely begun to take notice of the landscape.Many describe walking through the dunes as an intensely strange experience, surreal and vertigo inducing, or in several cases, described as being like a drug induced walking dream. The rock is certainly a photographer’s delight, where professionals and amateurs strive to take the perfect mid-day shot when not a single shadow eclipses the Wave, or they go for the more dramatic effect of morning or near-twilight that comes with the high domes casting stark shadows on the land.While the rocks have been hardened, they are still susceptible to damage. Only 20 visitors a day are allowed to walk through the ravine, and permits are required. The permits are issued through online and in person lotteries, and tour guides are available for hire.",Rippling sand dunes frozen in the Arizona rock. ,"Navajo Bridge,The Wahweap Hoodoos,Lee's Ferry and Lonely Dell","House Rock Road Marble Canyon, Arizona, 86036 United States",36.9961,-112.0061,renakabave897969mbisonrscottjoneserjefferyWhiskeyBristlesvve897969erjefferymmateoboneoWhiskeyBristlesrscottjonesmmbison,2010-01-26 00:00:00,"The Wahweap Hoodoos,Navajo Bridge,Lee's Ferry and Lonely Dell,Horseshoe Bend","Kanaio Coast,Cabezon Peak,The Smoking Hills,Námafjall",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wave-rock
1089, John Rylands Research Institute and Library,"libraries,books",571,1027,"Like almost anybody with a library named after them, John Rylands was a very rich man. The owner of Britain’s largest textile manufacturer in the late 19th century, Rylands was Manchester’s first multimillionaire. After his death in 1888, his widow Enriqueta Rylands undertook a memorial to her late husband that would be a lasting gift to the city of Manchester.The resulting John Rylands Research Institute and Library is just that, in both architectural and academic terms. The building, commissioned in 1889, is considered one of the most outstanding examples of neo-Gothic architecture in all of Europe, while also seamlessly incorporating Arts and Crafts details and Art Nouveau metalwork throughout.Built in a central neighborhood in Manchester, on a tightly-bounded lot, surrounded by narrow streets and tall warehouses, the building was built in a soaring cathedral-like style, with the many tall windows designed to admit good reading light adding to the churchy appearance. Indeed, the main reading room has been described as providing a “cloister quietude,” being situated in the center of the building and 30 feet above street level in order to escape the industrial and commercial din of Manchester.The library’s collection began with the purchase in 1892 of the private library of the 2nd Earl Spencer, widely considered to be one of the best private libraries in Europe. Consisting of some 43,000 items — including thousands of rarities, particularly prints predating 1501 — this so-called “Althorp Library” was supplemented by hundreds of other books and manuscripts collected by the avid Mrs. Ryland.There were some bibliophiles who were dismayed to see all these valuable books go to Manchester, as there was a great deal of air pollution (or as the library’s architect charmingly put it, the “atmosphere” was “somewhat charged with chemicals”) in the heavily industrialized city. To address this problem, the bookcases incorporated elaborate locks and seals to protect the books, and a remarkably advanced (for the time) air filtration system was employed, passing the air intake through wet screens and mists of water to capture particulate matter before reaching the building’s interior. The library was also one of the first buildings in Manchester to use electric lighting, and produced its own power via an onsite generator until 1950.Originally opened to the public on January 1, 1900, today the John Rylands Research Institute and Library is part of the University of Manchester’s library system and houses over 250,000 books and more than a million manuscripts and archival items. The library’s outstanding collection includes medieval illuminated manuscripts, an original Gutenberg Bible, and the oldest known fragment of the New Testament.",A Victorian Gothic masterpiece housing a world-class collection of rare books and manuscripts. ,"Peterloo Memorial,Manchester and Salford Junction Canal,The Manchester Bee","150 Deansgate Manchester, England, M3 3EH United Kingdom",53.4804,-2.2488,Snea Lea NeaehorkleySEANETTAreley250moominereRHyzer,2016-02-23 00:00:00,"Manchester and Salford Junction Canal,The Manchester Bee,Peterloo Memorial,The Undamaged Red Post Box","The Ancient Books of Wales,Suzzallo Library Reading Room,Bryant Park Escape Hatch,Reversing Hall Agrarian Library",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/john-rylands-research-institute-and-library
1090,Al Johnson’s Swedish Restaurant,"goats,restaurants",648,847,"The population of Door County, a peninsula in Northern Wisconsin, is only about 28,000. Nonetheless, the county generates around $280 million in tourism revenue each year, or $10,000 in tourism dollars per capita. It’s safe to say that Door County is tourism central for Wisconsinites.Al Johnson’s Swedish Restaurant, located in Sister Bay, a tourist-packed Door County town, takes full advantage with an eye-catching sight on the exterior of the restaurant that pulls in passing tourists. The grassy roof is covered with goats. Every summer day, tourists flock around the building’s exterior to photograph, smile, and laugh at the prancing creatures.It all started in 1973, when the Johnson family decided to renovate the restaurant to look like a log cabin, with a sod roof on the top and all materials coming straight from Norway.Noticing this, Wink Larsen, a friend of the owner, half-jokingly remarked, “you should put a goat up there.” After weeks and weeks of prodding, Larsen took matters into his own hands and hauled Oscar, a big Billy goat, all the way up to the roof. Despite Larsen ultimately tumbling over backwards and breaking his collarbone, his actions got the Johnson family to take his plan seriously. Suddenly, the Johnson family began importing goats straight from Scandinavia. To this day, they’re kept at an expansive, 40-acre farm just three quarters of a mile from the restaurant. Every summer day, the goats are led up a wooden ramp into the back of a pickup truck, and when they arrive at the restaurant minutes later, they eagerly scamper onto the roof.Why wouldn’t they? The roof of Al Johnson’s is a verdant pasture and the curvature of the ceiling makes for a perfect rolling hill. The goats eat above while the tourists dine on Swedish meatballs made daily at Al Johnson’s below. ",Restaurant in Northern Wisconsin comes with a unique feature: a grassy roof covered in living goats. ,"Eagle Tower,Washington Island Stave Church ,Nelsen’s Hall & Bitters Club","10698 N Bay Shore Dr Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant Sister Bay, Wisconsin, 54234",45.1899,-87.12,lewblankhrnickDavidBmanRin Wolfe,2016-04-28 00:00:00,"Eagle Tower,Nelsen’s Hall & Bitters Club,Washington Island Stave Church ,Schoolhouse Beach","Restaurante La Oruga,The Consulate,Tai Tung,Tsaghkunk Restaurant",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/al-johnsons-swedish-restaurant
1091,Old Charleston City Jail,"jails,crime,crime and punishment",664,849,"Charleston, South Carolina’s old city jail has a long and haunting past that can still be explored today.The original structure was built in 1802 and served as the city jail from 1803 to 1939. The front interior of the jail still retains the original structure that was built in 1802, but the rest of the jail as it is today was built in 1855 when it was remodeled and the arched façade, towers, and octagon were added to give the jail an authentically imposing appearance.The jail housed a number of convicts ranging from murderers to petty criminals throughout its extensive history. Each floor of the jail kept a different type of inmate. The ground floor accommodated the jailers and the “gentleman” prisoners. The second floor held the minor criminals like debtors and prostitutes, and the third floor retained the hardened criminals such as murderers and thieves.While there is documented proof that a few of the more hardened offenders were hanged in the jail yard, many of the prisoners in the Charleston City Jail were petty criminals at best. Most prisoners died from natural causes or diseases at the jail, not from brutal torture or being hanged for their criminal offenses.During the Civil War, Union POWs were incarcerated inside the jail. There were hundreds of Union soldiers who passed through the jail, so many that the jail itself could not contain them and the majority of the Union POWs were forced to stay out in the jail yard in dilapidated tents.In 1886, a great earthquake rattled Charleston and although the jail survived, parts of the structure were severely damaged. A ventilation tower and the fourth floor of the jail were torn down, never to be replaced. The 20 foot wall that encircled the jail suffered so much damage that it was reduced down to 15 feet. A workhouse that had been built beside the jail did not survive the earthquake and had to be demolished.In 1911, a man by the name of Daniel Duncan, who was convicted of murder, was officially the last person hanged at the jail. The gallows were dismantled and removed, never to be used again. By the 1930s the jail was in its decline and the city of Charleston along with the Housing Authority, wanted to build new low income apartment buildings across the street from the jail.A playground was to be built inside the jail yard, so eleven more feet of the original wall was removed to allow more sunlight into the jail yard. The bricks that were removed from the wall were used to build the apartment buildings across from the jail. After 136 years as the Charleston City Jail, it was decommissioned and closed its doors on September 16, 1939.The jail sat abandoned and was only used for storage for the next 40 years before becoming a museum in the late 1970s. In the late 1990s, the Charleston Housing Authority sold the jail to what would eventually become the American College of the Building Arts. The school was not granted a license till 2004. The college now uses the jail as a learning tool while also renovating and restoring the historical structure.Update as of September 2022: The jail is closed indefinitely for renovations.",Charleston's historic city jail once held everyone from pirates to Civil War POWs. ,"Giant's Causeway Pillar ,Unitarian Church Cemetery,Fireproof Building and South Carolina Historical Society","21 Magazine Street Charleston, South Carolina United States",32.7785,-79.9372,AndolinaHAshleyGizzysMamaalthechampionCollector of ExperiencesnashvegasoboealthechampionallisooonkCollector of ExperiencesSSarahKTAshleynnashvegasoboeGGizzysMama,2015-07-01 00:00:00,"Unitarian Church Cemetery,Giant's Causeway Pillar ,Fireproof Building and South Carolina Historical Society,Old Slave Mart","Old Prison of Trois-Rivières,Wheatley Lock-Up,Heidelberg Studentenkarzer ,Death Cell Door of Calton Jail",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-charleston-city-jail
1092,Mooresville's Gravity Hill,"gravity hill,optical illusions,optical oddities",208,845,"It’s best to be careful when driving along country roads—particularly if those roads are in Mooresville, Indiana. One could encounter any number of creatures or farm equipment on a typical country lane, but in Mooresville, you’re also likely to encounter basketballs, cars parked in neutral and maybe even a few curious pedestrians holding bags of flour—all at the bottom of one captivating hill which seems to be pulling everything upward, against gravity.Mooresville’s famous Gravity Hill (near Magnetic Acres) is an optical illusion, but it is a convincing one. If one were to put their car in neutral at the “bottom” of the hill (or place a ball in the road, for the safety-conscious), the hill will immediately start to pull it “up” - in the wrong direction, according to our old friend gravity.Legend has it that a school bus stalled at the bottom of this hill decades ago when it intersected with a railroad track, then was struck by an oncoming train, killing several riders. Nowadays, the locals will tell you that it’s the spirits of the children on that bus that push things uphill and out of harm’s way.

1093,Lunch Box Museum,"collections,museums",158,845,"Lunch boxes bring back a certain sense of nostalgia for most people. What most people don’t know however, is that these cherished, childhood, snack-bearing boxes, or at least the old metal ones, were once classified as weapons. For a while, lunchboxes were illegal.The metal lunch pail made its appeal to American youth in the 1920s. At first, many were plain and lacked any sense of individualism. Eventually, companies, of which Disney was the first, started releasing licenses to lunch box makers to use their characters and iconic figures as decals. It was during this time that lunch boxes began to signify a child’s individualism and uniqueness. The design on your lunch box said something about who you were.In the 1970s, a group of outraged, disgruntled, Floridian mothers lobbied against the metal boxes, saying children were swinging them at peers and wreaking havoc on their gentle skulls. Many other states soon followed and popular lunch box companies were forced to switch to vinyl products. The last metal box was produced in 1985.1998 saw the reappearance of new metal lunch boxes with designs such as Godzilla and Hot Wheels. After their release, there was no outcry.Though it seems like there would be a large variety of lunch boxes created, the truth is, between 1951 and 1985, only 450 metal lunch boxes were released with distinctive character designs. All other lunchboxes are not considered collectibles.A collector by the name of Allen Woodall, who operates the Lunch Box Museum in Georgia, has achieved the task of acquiring all 450 metal lunch boxes, as well as a handful of copies. He began collecting lunchboxes in the 1990s after he inherited a small collection from a deceased friend. He continued to collect lunch boxes and, after a promise he made to the widow of his deceased friend, started the museum.Today, Woodall’s museum is stuffed with some 3,500 metal lunch boxes and their matching thermoses. His collection grows as he continues to trade his duplicates for rarer pails, some of which are valued over $2,500. As children once traded food from their lunch boxes in the cafeteria, Woodall continues to trade his vast collection of metal lunch boxes.",A stockpile of childhood lunch pails turned collectibles. ,"Circus Train Wreck Victims Memorial ,The Drive-Thru Museum,Coca Cola Inventor's Grave","3218 Hamilton Road Columbus, Georgia, 31904 United States",32.4944,-84.9796,CPilgrimleefordwatfordAdventureSisMom0jaMolly McBride JacobsonAdventureBrokkwgriffith86AdventureSisAdventureBroleefordwatfordekjacksonMolly McBride JacobsonMom0ja,2009-02-18 00:00:00,"Coca Cola Inventor's Grave,Circus Train Wreck Victims Memorial ,The Drive-Thru Museum,The Museum Of Wonder","Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum,Collectible and Antique Chair Gallery,Homografiska Museet,Börje’s Tie Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lunch-box-museum
1094,Bankhead Ghost Town,"national parks,mines,railroads,ghost towns,mountains,parks,abandoned,ruins,history",174,844,"Once a bustling mining town operated by the Canadian Pacific Railroad, the crumbling ruins of Bankhead now lie abandoned up in the mountains of Banff National Park. Educational plaques and an interpretive trail tell the tale of what one historian dubbed “the twenty year town.”Bankhead was established as a company town in 1903 to provide coal to CPR locomotives and Banff Springs Hotel boilers. By 1905 the frontier community was dotted with homes, shops, community buildings, even a school. In its heyday, 300 men worked the mines beneath Bankhead and excavated 200,000 tons of coal per year.While the supply of coal underneath Bankhead was plentiful, actually getting at it was another matter. Much of the stuff lay in difficult to access folding and faulted seams that forced miners to dig an inefficient 185-mile-plus network of tunnels and ventilation shafts underneath the town.A historical brochure notes that the unusually brittle coal was far from ideal for the railroad. “As soon as it was exposed to the air, it began to crumble;” and at the end of the production line “nearly half of it was classified as ‘dust.”Bankhead was ultimately undone not by its coal but by poor relations between the miners and the railroad. In a decade known for its labor strikes, there were several walkouts in Bankhead that won the workers higher wages, but exacerbated the mine’s cashflow problems. An April 1922 strike broke the camel’s back, and CPR simply closed the coal mine. Since Bankhead was a company town all economic activity dried up with the mine, and the residents drifted away. In 1930 the National Parks Act forbade future logging or mining in Banff, and Bankhead’s fate as a ghost town was locked in place.","The ruins of the ""20-year town"" lay out among the mountains of Alberta. ","Lake Minnewanka Underwater Ghost Town,Banff Merman,Grizzly House","Bankhead Banff National Park Bankhead, Alberta",51.2296,-115.5241,Elliot Carternews6850,2017-08-11 00:00:00,"Lake Minnewanka Underwater Ghost Town,Grizzly House,Banff Merman,Banff Springs Hotel","The Lost Town of Proctor,Gay City State Park,Minas dos Carris,Mariscal Mine",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bankhead-ghost-town

On the contrary, Houtouwan may well be the most verdant and stunningly green village the world over, as nearly every building is overgrown with ivy and other lush vegetation.This green gem, situated about 40 miles from Shanghai, was once an active settlement, inhabited by around 2,000 fishermen and their families. In the early 1990s, when the small bay became increasingly unable to meet the growing fish industry’s needs, residents began migrating to the mainland in search of other employment and a better life, a pattern that was common in many small Chinese villages. Slowly, nearly every house was abandoned, and only a handful of residents now remain. Over the past two decades, the forces of green took over, plastering nearly every surface of the settlement with dense overgrown foliage. Adding to the otherworldliness, a peek inside the deserted houses reveals decaying household items and pieces of furniture frozen exactly as they were placed years ago before the inhabitants left. Now, some villagers who used to live in Houtouwan have found another form of income in tourism, showing an ever-increasing stream of visitors the lush landscape, and selling them water, the only item on offer on the island.

That same year, Fite—who was then a professor of the Fine Arts at nearby Bard College—was invited to Honduras by the Carnegie Institute to do sculptural restoration work. During his season of work in Honduras, Fite was awestruck by the dry-stone building methods employed thousands of years prior by the Mayans and was thus inspired to use the heaps of stone in his own quarry to create an outdoor gallery in which to showcase his own sculptures.He began what would become his most ambitious work in 1939 by first diverting water from a spring within the quarry to create two large pools. Around these pools, he constructed curving walls connected by cobbled pathways and labyrinthine staircases. Over twenty years after starting his work on Opus 40, Fite realized that the scale of his stone landscape had begun to overwhelm his smaller sculptures and that the landscape had become a sculpture in its own right. He removed his figurative works from the main site, placing some of them, which still stand to this day, nearer his house on the eastern edge of the quarry. For the next decade, Fite continued to refine, rebuild, and extend his earthwork, eventually installing the stately nine-ton, monolith at the work’s highest point. After his retirement from Bard College in the early 1970s, he built the Quarryman’s Museum on the grounds to house his private collection of folk tools and artifacts of the quarrying era. Around this same time, he finally gave a name to his masterwork. Fite jokingly said “Classical composers don’t have to name things, they can just number them Opus One, Opus Two, and so on.” Expecting that he would need 40 years to complete the work, it become known as Opus 40. Fite died in an accident during the thirty-seventh year of his labors. And while some areas are certainly left unfinished, Fite’s stepson Jonathan Richards observes, “Opus 40 is as complete as it ever would have been. It was the product of Fite’s ceaseless vision, and could only have been stopped by his death.”Today, the site is open to visitors thanks to Barbara Fite, Harvey Fite’s widow, who created a nonprofit group which still administers the site. A short monograph is screened on a loop in the admissions building where visitors can also visit the Quarryman’s Museum. Above the amphitheater within the quarry, visitors can use provided stones to construct their own homage to Fite’s work. Opus 40 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 and has been described in Architectural Digest as “one of the largest and most beguiling works of art on the entire continent.”",One man's swirling six-acre monument of stone. ,"Woodstock School of Art Sculpture Garden,Overlook Mountain House Ruins,Woodstock Artists Cemetery","50 Fite Road Saugerties, New York, 12477 United States",42.0507,-74.0317,horizon factoryjenneidemagickboymbison,2016-08-09 00:00:00,"Woodstock School of Art Sculpture Garden,Overlook Mountain House Ruins,Woodstock Artists Cemetery,Mayan Ruins on the Hudson","Yonekoyaki Craft Center Shisa Park,Selárdalur Valley,The American Visionary Art Museum,Fred Smith's Wisconsin Concrete Park",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/opus-40

As America’s oldest and northernmost example, Green Gardens has remained a destination for botanical enthusiasts across three centuries.The seven-acre estate perched on the edge of the Narragansett Bay was originally purchased in 1872 by Joseph Brayton. Shortly thereafter, Brayton commissioned a well-regarded Portuguese gardener by the name of Joseph Carreiro to turn the landscape surrounding his home into an otherworldly art garden. Carreiro set to work laying the foundation for what can be seen at Green Gardens to this day, focusing much of his efforts on creating live vegetation sculptures.Topiariy animals made by Carreiro’s kin in the 1940s were crafted from California privet and yew, heartier plants that are more suited to the sometimes extreme climate of Rhode Island than the boxwood used in more traditional landscape sculptures. Fantastic imaginary figures such as unicorns and a Don Quixote stand along side exotic replicas of camels, elephants and giraffes. In addition to the eponymous animals, flowers and ponds saturate the landscape, and more than 60 topiary trees carved into elaborate geometric shapes guide visitors on winding paths through the grounds.After the passing of Alice Brayton, who had inherited her father’s gardens, Green Animals was left in the care of the current operators, the Preservation Society of Newport County.

1099,Pullman Historic District ,"company town,utopia week,architectural oddities,architecture",571,844,"Built in 1880 on 4,000 acres of land outside of the Chicago city limits, Pullman, Illinois, was the first industrial planned community in the United States.George Pullman, of the Pullman (railroad) Car Company, built the south residential portion of the company town first, which contained 531 houses, some of which stand today more or less as they did originally.The first permanent residents moved into the town on January 1, 1881. By April, the Pullman car shops were in operation, and by May, more than 350 people lived in Pullman. At its peak, the town was entirely company-owned, providing housing, markets, a library, a church, and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and an equal number of dependents.The design of a suburban working-class community was a radical notion for the time. However, the rigid class structure of the town was immediately evident. The executive row of houses was located closest to the factory, to spare the executives from passing the working-class residences. The housing for the foremen was slightly more modest, and bordered a large park.The worker housing was the smaller, cheaper, and farther away from the factory, but was unprecedented in its quality for the time. The rowhouses contained amenities that were not standard in working-class housing at the time, including indoor plumbing, gas, regular garbage pick-up, and sewers. The town was mostly built using elements of American Queen Anne architecture. Architectural continuity was maintained by similarity of proportions, repetition of key details, and setbacks from the street.Employees were not required to live in Pullman, though preferential treatment was given to those who did.  Alcohol was prohibited, as George Pullman found it a distasteful habit for his workers. It was available in the company’s Hotel Florence for the benefit of the hotel guests, but was generally too expensive for laborers. New towns and breweries sprang up nearby to satisfy the workers alcohol needs.The demand for Pullman cars slackened during the recession of 1894. The Pullman Company laid off hundreds of workers and reduced the wages of the remaining labor force. Despite these cutbacks, the Company did not reduce rents for those that lived in the town of Pullman. As a result, the Pullman Strike began in 1894, and lasted for 2 months. It spread across the railroad industry and, at its peak, involved 250,000 workers in 27 states.After the turmoil of the strike, the Illinois Supreme Court required the company to sell off the town. It was annexed by the City of Chicago in 1889. The town gradually became a regular Chicago neighborhood, only with distinguishing Victorian architecture.In 1960, the original Town of Pullman was threatened with total demolition to make way for an industrial park. The residents there formed the Pullman Civic Organization and saved their community. By 1972 the Pullman Historic District had obtained National, State, and City landmark status to protect the original row houses and public buildings, including Hotel Florence, the Greenstone Church, and the Pullman School. President Obama named Pullman a National Monument in 2015, the first and only National Parks designation in Chicago. The National Parks is currently undertaking a multimillion dollar renovation of the Administration Building, which will be reimagined as a full service visitor center. The area is seeing new development for the first time in decades, with new retail recently opened, and in the works is ArtSpace Lofts, a mixed-use affordable live/ work space for artists and their families, being developed in partnership with Artspace Projects, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, and PullmanArts. ",First planned industrial community in the United States.  ,"Grave of Andreas von Zirngibl,95th Street Bridge,Calumet Fisheries","11111 S.

After just happening on the stand, she purchased it without a real idea of what she would do with it. She later moved it to its current Joshua Tree home and covered it in a layer of lime-green paint. Her collection of crocheted items had been placed in storage, but she carted it out and arranged it along the new shelves she built inside.Among the eclectic collection you’ll find just about every conceivable type of item, represented in crochet form. There are animals like poodles, bears, and unicorns. There are also more abstract designs, like smiley faces and lumpy little creations that are less identifiable.The upbeat collection celebrates the eclectic tastes of its owner as much as it does the art of crochet. With few other contenders to for the title, this little roadside oddity may just be as famous as its sign claims.   ",An old California photo stand has been turned into a shrine to the cozy art of crochet. ,"Desert View Conservation Area,'Krblin Jihn Kabin',Beauty Bubble Salon and Museum","61855 Twentynine Palms Highway Joshua Tree, California, 92252 United States",34.1349,-116.3138,lasvegashoosiererjefferymetexanvthanaRobNZpragmaticaxxkettnerdxhhoursvarychasepoptccesareFFindingbalance18RRobNZmmetexanvterjefferySScottFromWyomingppragmaticahana,2015-10-13 00:00:00,"Beauty Bubble Salon and Museum,'Krblin Jihn Kabin',Desert View Conservation Area,Institute of Mentalphysics","Art Cartopia Museum,Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum,ReGEN Haus,Novis Mortem Collective",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-famous-crochet-museum

There was one thing he always wanted to see; the freakshow.At one such show, Ray met “the human cigarette factory,” a man who rolled and smoked cigarettes without the use of his deformed hands and legs. Puffing away, he told Ray, “Remember son, you can do anything in life.”When Ray grew up he moved to California and became a successful music producer, but despite working with artists such as Santana and the Beastie Boys, he never forgot “the human cigarette factory” and his love of oddities. A collector all his life, after retiring from the music business Ray moved his collections to a storefront on the beach and opened the Venice Beach Freakshow, a throwback to the kind of dime museums that once inhabited Venice Beach.Today the Freakshow has amassed the largest collection of two headed animals in the world. It has, among many others, a two headed cow, two headed chicken, two headed raccoon, a pair of two headed turtles and many, many more (Over 10 Animals with Two Heads that are ALIVE!). The collection also includes shrunken heads, Rocky The Five-Legged Dog (Seen on the Dog Whisperer), Tony The Two Tailed Iguana, a giant Alaskan king crab and a ‘genuine’ chupacabra. You can also see some of the Strangest Performers on The Planet....Sword Swallowers, Fire Eaters, Electra The Electric Lady, Lady Twisto The Rubber Girl, The Creature, Sangora The Snake Lady, The Indestructible Woman, and more.

The sign out front reads “since 1964,” but the operation dates back to at least 1910. James Jones’s family recipes are the same ones that his grandfather used when he sold barbecued meat out of his home and that his father used when he opened up an earlier iteration of the restaurant, known as “the Hole in the Wall” (so-called because his father served everything through a window).Today, James runs the pit and restaurant, while a man named Sylvester chops wood and operates the attached smokehouse, which is a shed. Oak and hickory logs burn in a cinderblock barbecue pit, where pork shoulders—the only meat they sell—smoke for 12 hours at a time. Aside from pork by the pound, the menu also includes sandwiches.The simplicity of the sandwiches reminds diners that perfect barbecue needs no smoke and mirrors, only smoke. Jones dresses the pork with slightly-sweet vinegar sauce and serves it between white bread. Beyond slaw, sides are nonexistent. As for what makes the ’cue so special?

1106,Ebenezer Floppen Slopper's Wonderful Abandoned Water Slides,"waterparks,waterworks,water,abandoned",114,843,"From a passing glance, it simply looks like a large, overgrown hill. Step closer, and you’ll find the abandoned remnants of a once wild and wonderful waterpark.Hidden in the brambles by Route 83 in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, you will find what is left of Ebenezer Floppen Slopper’s Wonderful Water Slides. When it first opened in 1980, the park had only two simple water slides. As it quickly grew into a major area attraction, the activities expanded, and the lines grew long.Some of the slides involved sitting on rubber mats and going in groups, others entailed sliding down headfirst or atop an inner tube. A rubbery foam material lining the slides prevented people from injuring themselves against the walls. In 1987, adding bumps to the bottoms of the concrete slides transformed part of the park into “Doc River’s Roaring Rapids.”The park came to a sudden close in 1989. No one knew why, and with decades of neglect and disuse, the once vibrant hotspot fell into eerie disrepair. Some of the slides are now decorated in graffiti, while others have become home to a variety of insects and animals. Interestingly, Ebenezer Floppen Slopper’s has returned to its original state of being—before any of the slides came about, the property was actually a landfill.Technically called a cold-fill, and back before the days of stricter environmental regulation, the place held non-methane-emitting waste. In the 1960s it was known locally as “Mt. Trashmore.” When the dump filled up to ground level, it was shut down and covered with concrete, brick, and clay and was soon overgrown with grass and weeds. It wasn’t until the late 1970s, when a man named Mark Collor spotted the hill along Illinois 83, that the seed of the water park was planted.Nowadays, though you won’t have much luck with the water slides, the undergrowth of Ebenezer Floppen Slopper’s Wonderful Water Slides provides a new type of adventure.",This overgrown Illinois water park offers a whole new type of adventure. ,"The Italian Bride,Barbara A.

The farm, which grows both corn and pumpkins, was started by Jan Lawyer, who had a knack both for fixing things and for creating things out of next to nothing. Most memorably, Jan created a handful of giant Transformer-like robots that he installed at the entrance. He built the giant robot sculptures from scratch, using old junk and car parts.Jan has since passed away, but his creations still stand, welcoming people to the farmstead. Today, the property is owned and operated by his children and it is not just junk statues that are on offer. The farm also offers visitors the chance to see their homemade pumpkin cannons, and take a stroll through the corn maze, which is newly designed each fall. You can even go pumpkin picking if you are so inclined. In honor of Jan, some of the proceeds go to the American Brain Tumor Association.The flamboyant farm makes sure to keep its corn maze fresh. In 2015, they carved the maze to look like Governor Larry Hogan, who was battling cancer, even carving out a hashtag, proving that maybe corn mazes aren’t so old-fashioned after all.  Update as of September 2020: There are several junk bots back up on the property again.Update as of August 2022: The farm has been bought and there are only two robots still on the property.

Their pay was 50 cents to a dollar a day.At 32 feet wide and 109 feet deep, it is indeed a very big well, though despite its claim the Big Well isn’t quite the largest hand-dug in the world. The Pozzo di S. Patrizio or St. Patrick’s Well, built in 1527 in Orvieto, Italy is, at 42 feet by 200 feet, larger. The Big Well is certainly the largest hand-dug well in the United States.The residents of Greensburg have long been proud of their well, recently named one of the eight wonders of Kansas, but maintaining it hasn’t always been easy going. The well was a popular stop from 1939 to the present, with millions buying the two-dollar ticket to take a journey down into the well and throwing a coin, shoe, or other lucky items into the bottom.  In 1956 the well celebrated its one-millionth visitor. In the 1990s the town hired divers to clean the bottom of the well and many things were found such as shoes, eyeglasses, chewing gum, and approximately $1,200 in coins. But around the same time, it seemed that the well’s supply of tourists had dried up.Even worse, in 2007 a tornado destroyed almost the entire town, including the Well’s visitor center, leaving only a few buildings and, of course, the well itself. But what was initially a disaster became a chance for the citizens of Greensburg to put themselves and their well on the map. The town began rebuilding as the most “environmentally friendly little town” in America. Solar panels and wind turbines were installed and, with the help of the TV show Planet Green, which was about the town’s recovery and conversion to green tech, the town began to receive attention and visitors, many of whom made a stop by the Big Well.Greensburg decided that as well as renovating the town, it was time to renovate the Big Well and a $3 million museum was built in 2012. This new museum once again allows visitors to descend a spiral staircase into the Big Well and view exhibits that feature Greensburg’s history, the tornado, and the town’s rebuilding as a sustainable community.",The United States's largest hand-dug well is topped with a state-of-the-art museum. ,"Dalton Gang Hideout & Museum,The Sculptures of M.T.

It is known in equal parts for its bizarre splendor and its seedy history.Started in 1968 by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. ISKCON New Vrindaban serves as community for Hare Krishna followers. Devotees adhere to the teachings of Sri Krishna, including the preservation and advocacy for cows as holy beings; a special Cow Protection section was established in the community. At its peak in the mid-1980s, New Vrindaban was home to almost 400 permanent community members of all ages, though current population estimates measure only 100 residents.During the 1970s and 1980s, the untrained and unpaid devotees constructed the Palace of Gold, sometimes referred to as “America’s Taj Mahal.” Though they hardly knew how to lay stones when they started, an estimated $600,000 worth of materials ranging from marble, onyx, teak, and 22-karat gold leaf were formed into the Palace as it appears today, complete with terraces, turrets, manicured lawns, and exquisite stained glass work. The structure stands as a memorial to the founder of ISKCON and opens its doors year round to visitors interested basking in its mirrored ceilings, polished mosaic floors, and beautiful vistas.So where does a self-sustaining mountainous community find the capital for such undertakings? There’s the rub. In 1987, Kirtanananda Swami was indicted on charges of racketeering and fraud. Moreover, the swami has as been accused of murdering a pair of mutinous community members, as well as permitting child abuse and facilitating drug trafficking. Ultimately, the swami pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in 1996 and was sentenced to 20 years in a North Carolina prison. Subsequently, the swami was barred from life from ISKCON and prohibited from returning to his mountain commune upon release.Despite this episode, the remaining residents of New Vrindaban continue to persevere in attempts to rebuild their public image. Starting in 2011, a large four and a half million dollar restoration effort has been underway to restore and renew the magnificent palace. ","Despite its lavish ornamentation, and wholesome lifestyle of its devotees, this mountain commune has faced its share of issues. ","Unofficial Lego Toy and Plastic Brick Museum ,West Virginia State Penitentiary,Grave Creek Mound","ISKCON New Vrindaban 3759 McCreary's Ridge Rd.

The well, which sits at the top of the “den” is said to have been used for human sacrifice by ancient druids, although it is more likely that it was simply revered as a natural wonder. Stairs carved into the cliff during a bygone Pagan era lead down into the den proper. Here Celtic crosses and symbols have been carved into the cliff face by worshippers both modern and ancient. Pagan pilgrims venturing to the site leave offerings of all kinds hanging from the trees and tucked into crevices in the cliffs, from coins to ribbons to panties.A “wishing stone” is located in the cemetery of the Kirk, which dates to the 1800s. Located along the southern wall is a large stone believed to be from the 9th-century. It has been reported that at one time it was used as a sundial towards the end of the 1600s.

Tolkien’s The Hobbit via crude cement tableaus of key scenes and characters, but today all that remains of the attraction are a sparse bit of faded ruins. Erected sometime in the mid-1970s, Hobbiton USA was attempted to grab onto the then ascendant popularity of Tolkien’s fantasy novels. Their half-mile nature walk led visitors through the story of Bilbo Baggins, illustrating such scenes as Gandalf arriving to enlist Bilbo’s help, Bilbo’s encounter with the spiders of Mirkwood, and the climactic battle with the dragon Smaug. Far from the litigious scrutiny that would have been brought down on the attraction today, the scenes presented the characters in lovingly ball-parked cement sculptures that left characters such as Gollum and Aragorn almost unrecognizable. However, each little diorama had a voicebox that would narrate the details of the scene with the push of a button.While a number of attractions in this section of the Redwoods still attract passing visitors, Hobbiton, USA seems to have closed down sometime around 2009. However, according to reports, Gandalf can still be seen standing out front of Bilbo’s round hobbit hole door in the first diorama, overgrown and fading, but still holding a bit of homegrown magic.Update as of October 3rd, 2021: The Gandalf statue in front of Bilbo’s hobbit hole has been vandalized.

Walden Pond is beautiful, but its history is what makes it unique.In the early nineteenth century, with the invention of the ice box and other preservation techniques, the demand for ice skyrocketed around the globe. Frederic Tudor, a Boston native, started up a shipping company which began harvesting ice from ten different lakes around Boston, including Walden Pond. As the Tudor Ice Company grew, he became known as Boston’s “Ice King,” and Tudor ice filled glasses and ice boxes from Boston to Bombay. After watching Tudor Company ice harvesters carve into the lake, Henry David Thoreau wrote, “the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, of Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well … The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.”From 1845 to 1847, while residing on the lakeside property of his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau penned Walden; or, Life in the Woods. A pillar of American literature, Walden explored simplistic living and harmony with nature. Known for his transcendentalist philosophies and support of civil disobedience, Thoreau’s writings influenced noted figures like John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Ernest Hemingway, and Mohandas Gandhi, among others. In fact, Gandhi credited Thoreau’s work with galvanizing him in the fight for Indian independence, calling him “one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced.”Walden Pond is a beautiful lake with clear, cool water perfect for swimming on a hot summer day. It is a quintessential example of New England scenery, a nature preserve home to countless local flora and fauna. But it is also a moment, suspended in time; a piece of history that continues to inspire visitors to follow in Thoreau’s famous words: “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”","""the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, of Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well . . .

1115,The Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave,"wild west,catacombs and crypts,graves,gravestones,museums and collections,museums",1254,842,"American soldier, bison hunter, and showman, Buffalo Bill Cody became internationally acclaimed after founding “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West,” a touring vaudeville showcase featuring scenes of the American frontier and performances by the likes of Annie Oakley, Wild Bill Hickok, and even Sitting Bull. By 1887 Buffalo Bill’s troupe was touring Europe, performing for foreign royalty, and exhibiting for prestigious events such as the Exposition Universelle in Paris, France which featured the unveiling of the Eiffel Tower. While in Verona, the Wild West performed in the ancient Roman Amphitheater. His tours were so successful at home and abroad that by the turn of the century he was regarded as the most recognizable celebrity on earth.Aside from creating Buffalo Bills Wild West, Cody founded the town of Cody, Wyoming where he built hotels and ranches; he had a hand in early water reclamation, irrigation, and animal conservation, and was an early supporter of rights for both women and Native Americans.Cody died of kidney failure on January 10, 1917, surrounded by family and friends in Denver, Colorado. Upon the news of his death, tributes were made worldwide, by figures such as King George V of the United Kingdom, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Imperial Germany, and President Woodrow Wilson.Though Cody was buried on Colorado’s Lookout Mountain, a site selected by his wife and sister, the city of Cody, Wyoming, demanded a “return” on his body, feeling he should be buried within the town he founded. A rumor started that Cody’s actual body was exchanged for a look-alike indigent, and he had been taken to Cody for burial.  Considering that the funeral was open casket and attended by thousands, including close family and friends with photos taken of those same family and friends next to the casket, someone swapping Cody’s body is hard to believe. The controversy became so heated that a guard was mounted over the grave until a deeper shaft could be blasted into the rock below.The controversy continued with Cody’s niece claiming officials had exchanged the body following the death of Cody’s widow in 1925. Cody’s foster son, Johnny Baker, ordered Cody and his wife be disinterred and reburied under tons of concrete to prevent anyone from stealing their bodies. Today Buffalo Bill Cody’s grave can still be found at the top of Lookout Mountain in Golden, Colorado. A small museum resides nearby and is owned by the City and County of Denver, CO.","The final resting place of American icon Buffalo Bill, and a museum that aids in telling his tale. ","Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum,American Alpine Club Library,Mines Museum of Earth Science","987 Lookout Mountain Road Golden, Colorado, 80401 United States",39.7333,-105.2386,theamarantcyccommuteRachellittlebrumbletiffmMartin,2013-07-17 00:00:00,"Mines Museum of Earth Science,American Alpine Club Library,Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum,Sculptured House ","Tian Yi's Tomb,Boot Hill Cemetery,Boothill Graveyard,Grave of W.

1116,Tsavo Man Eaters,"dead explorers,hunting and taxidermy,memento mori,animals",1440,842,"“On reaching the spot where the body had been devoured, a dreadful spectacle presented itself. The ground all round was covered with blood and morsels of flesh and bones, but the unfortunate jemadar’s head had been left intact, save for the holes made by the lion’s tusks on seizing him, and lay a short distance away from the other remains, the eyes staring wide open with a startled, horrified look in them. The place was considerably cut up, and on closer examination we found that two lions had been there and had probably struggled for possession of the body. It was the most gruesome sight I had ever seen. We collected the remains as well as we could and heaped stones on them, the head with its fixed, terrified stare seeming to watch us all the time, for it we did not bury, but took back to camp for identification before the Medical Officer. Thus occurred my first experience of man-eating lions, and I vowed there and then that I would spare no pains to rid the neighbourhood of the brutes.”-J.H. Patterson, “The Man-eaters of Tsavo”, 1907For nine months in 1898 workers on the British Kenya-Uganda Railway were terrorized, attacked, and eaten by two enormous lions. At least 35 people, and possibly as many as 135 (depending on the source), were killed by the stealthy lions named by natives “Ghost” and “Darkness.”The railway project was intended to link Mombasa, Kenya to Lake Victoria in Uganda in order to create a trade route for raw materials and British goods into Uganda. The project relied on the skills of thousands of imported Sikh laborers from British India along with local laborers. The lions were only one of many problems encountered during the construction process. To start with, much of the construction crossed through Masai tribal lands. In 1895, 500 workers were killed by Masai in retaliation for the alleged rape of two Masai girls.Back in Britain, many saw the project as a colossal waste of money. At the House of Lords the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, groused about the lack of progress on the railway: “The whole of the works were put a stop to for three weeks because a party of man-eating lions appeared in the locality and conceived a most unfortunate taste for our porters. At last the labourers entirely declined to go on unless they were guarded by an iron entrenchment. Of course it is difficult to work a railway under these conditions, and until we found an enthusiastic sportsman to get rid of these lions, our enterprise was seriously hindered.”From March to December the two lions picked off workers. Efforts to barricade work camps failed, and the work crew became increasingly terrified.Tsavo lions are different from savanna lions. They are exceptionally large, and the males are maneless. Their behavior in the wild is also different, and they may have become accustomed to seeing humans as easy prey following years of slave trains passing through their territory, where bodies of the dead were left where they fell.It fell to railway engineer J.H. Patterson to stalk and kill the man-eaters. Patterson was a skilled hunter, but not a professional marksman. He finally tracked and killed the first lion in December of 1898, and then shot the second lion three weeks later. It took 10 shots to kill the second lion. In his own words:“…in a short while I heard the lion begin to creep stealthily towards me. I could barely make out his form as he crouched among the whitish undergrowth; but I saw enough for my purpose, and before he could come any nearer, I took careful aim and pulled the trigger. The sound of the shot was at once followed by a most terrific roar, and then I could hear him leaping about in all directions. I was no longer able to see him, however, as his first bound had taken him into the thick bush; but to make assurance doubly sure, I kept blazing away in the direction in which I heard him plunging about. At length came a series of mighty groans, gradually subsiding into deep sighs, and finally ceasing altogether; and I felt convinced that one of the ‘devils’ who had so long harried us would trouble us no more.”In the wake of his heroism, Patterson went on to be a game warden in Kenya, and the book he wrote in 1907 about his time in Africa has become a classic of adventure writing.In 1924 Patterson visited the Chicago Field Museum to give a talk on his experiences with the man-eaters of Tsavo. After seeing the collections and receiving an enthusiastic welcome he offered the remains of the two lions, which had served as trophy rugs in his home for 25 years, to the museum for $5,000.Thanks to the skills of taxidermist Julius Friesser the lions are exceptionally lifelike for mounts of their age, particularly considering their years as floor coverings. The resulting lions are somewhat smaller than the size reported by Patterson in his book, which may have to do both with exaggeration or mismeasuring on his part and some trimming of the skins required, both for creating tidy rugs and later for fitting over three-dimensional taxidermy forms. They are displayed next to their skulls, also preserved by Patterson. In a separate display, the Field Museum also houses the largest man-eating lion on record. Measuring 10 feet, six inches in length, the “Man Eater of Mfuwe” was responsible for the deaths of 6 people, and was shot in 1991 by a hunter.Since the 1990s the Field Museum has been actively involved in further field research in the Tsavo National Parks. Researchers have studied the Tsavo maneless lions, and have located the man-eater’s lair as shown in Patterson’s book.The story’s fame was re-kindled by the 1996 film The Ghost and the Darkness, named for the two lions.In surprise the railways are still in use today. under the control of the Kenya Railways Corporation. As their territory is encroached upon, the Tsavo lions continue to occasionally snack on humans.",These pretty kitties killed and ate as many as 135 railway workers. ,"N. W.

Although the vision wasn’t real, they were inspired to plant a mailbox with a communal notebook so that visitors could leave proof of their having been there. Use of the mailbox quickly caught on and visitors flocked to the island to sit on a nearby bench, look out over the water and write their own personal message inside the mailbox’s journal.Sitting just off the coast of North Carolina, Bird Island was a prime target for resort development. But handwritten messages posted in the mailbox saved the island and it is now a nature preserve operated by the state.

Estimated to be 400 years old, the Mother Vine, located on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island, is believed to be the oldest grape vine in all of North America, planted by either Croatan Native Americans or settlers of the Lost Colony. Some have posited that it is the “mother” of all vines for scuppernong grapes, North Carolina’s state fruit.When Jack and Estelle Wilson bought the property housing the Mother Vine in 1957, its tangled branches occupied two acres. After they trimmed it to make room for a house, the Vine still occupies a third of their front yard in Manteo, stretching 30 feet by 120 feet. To make up for their extensive initial cutback, the couple have become its keepers.Not only do the octogenarian couple invite visitors to park and view the sprawling web, they have allowed their neighbors to pick and eat its grapes for years. In 2005, they permitted a local winery to plant clippings from the original vine in their vineyard and make Mother Vine Wine, a sweet, mildly acidic wine.","Perhaps the oldest vine in North America, this sprawling plant helps make a sweet wine. ","Jockey's Ridge,William B.

The biggest room in the limestone cave network, known as “Martel’s Chamber,” is a gaping canyon which was formed by the underground flow of the Reka river, which still rushes along the bottom of the chasm.Thanks to the amount of water that flows through the canyon, the caves also hold a number of eye-catching geological features such as limestone pools, travertine terraces, and giant stalagmite formations. The cave’s unique spaciousness also hosts a number of species of bat, countless unique bio-organisms, and even a variety of fish that have never seen the light of day. A bridge has been built spanning the chasm so visitors can experience the colossal geologic divide.Archeological research in the area found that the caves were home to humans as far back as 10,000 years in the past.

The clock displays the time, the phase of the moon, and the dominant sign of the Zodiac. Venetian legend holds that when the clock was revealed on February 1, 1499, it was so beautiful that the doge had the clockmaker blinded so that he could not create another to rival it.In reality, the two master mechanics of the clock were made its caretakers, beginning the tradition that the clock’s keepers live in the tower with their families.The clock tower is topped by two bronze figures who strike the bell hourly. Although they were originally designated as giants, their dark patina lent them the nickname “Moors.” A relief of the winged lion of St. Mark, patron saint and symbol of Venice, stands on an open book below the Moors. A statue of the Virgin Mary stands one level down, above the massive clock face. The clock was intentionally designed to sit high enough in the square to be protected from Venice’s waters and to be visible from the canal.On Ascension Week and Epiphany, carved figures of the four Magi join the Moors hourly, emerging from the clock face and bowing to the Virgin Mary above them. An angel raises a trumpet in recognition of them, and the Magi bow in return.Inside the tower, the clock mechanism shares space with living quarters. Guided tours climb the 19th-century spiral staircases inside the tower all the way up to the rooftop Moors.The clock and the tower buildings have been modified and restored many times over the years, including the addition of one of the world’s first digital displays in 1858. Two internal huge drums spin to display the hours and minutes in Roman and Arabic numerals on either side of the Madonna.Most recently, the clock emerged from scaffolding from the thorough overhauling of 1998-2006 in honor of the clock’s 500th anniversary. The bell that rings today is still the original cast at at the Arsenal in 1497. ",Go inside to really appreciate this 500-year-old technological masterpiece. ,"Reliquaries of St Mark's Basilica Treasury,St. Mark's Lost Third Column,Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs","Piazza San Marco Venice, 30124 Italy",45.4347,12.3389,Annetta BlackJaszmina Szendreyshaw95tylercoleRachelJulius SpadaJJulius SpadaJuan Pablo Pozo Hernandezbbsempowskireley250minactylercoleargusfotosshaw95MMartinRachelJaszmina SzendreyNicholas Jackson,2012-07-10 00:00:00,"Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs,Reliquaries of St Mark's Basilica Treasury,St. Mark's Lost Third Column,The Flooded Crypt of San Zaccaria","Prague Astronomical Clock ,Jantar Mantar,Bottle House of Ganja,Hammond Castle Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/torre-dell-orologio-venice-clock-tower

Most of these are built from green branches, though. In this case the whole tree is woven in place to form a living structure.Kalberer began his first construction in 1984 and since then has built more than 70 structures around Europe. He has also shared and explained his technique to others, and according to Kalberer, there are now more than 10,000 small willow constructions at schools and in private gardens around Germany.The Auerworld Palace is also the home to full moon dance parties known as the Auerworld Festivals, which have been going on since 1998, when this living palace was first created.",Living trees form the structure of an open-air palace. ,"Statue of Uta von Ballenstedt,Goseck Circle,Deutsches Kinderwagenmuseum (German Stroller Museum)","Auerstedt, 99518 Germany 51.1002, 11.5881NearbyStatue of Uta von Ballenstedt10.09 milesGoseck Circle13.77 milesDeutsches Kinderwagenmuseum (German Stroller Museum)23.65 miles",51.1002,11.5881,Annetta BlackmbisonlittlebrumbleRachel,2012-06-05 00:00:00,"Statue of Uta von Ballenstedt,Goseck Circle,Deutsches Kinderwagenmuseum (German Stroller Museum),Kika Figures of Erfurt","Borderland State Park Mansion,Nature Friends Tourist Club,Artigas Gardens,Jardin Rosa Mir ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auerworld-palace

The locals, it is said, were too afraid of the cave to go exploring because of the sound coming from the fast-moving underground river, as well as the huge vertical drop. In 2009, a group of scientists from the British Cave Research Association began an extensive survey of the cave’s depths. According to Howard Limbert, the man leading the survey, the cave is five times larger than Phong Nha, which once held the title of the largest in Vietnam. The biggest chamber, his team found, is over five kilometers long and 200 meters tall.The jungle found inside of the cave has formed underneath a collapsed roof in one of the caverns. After the roof collapsed, enough light spilled into the cavern that vegetation was able to creep in slowly from outside.

No mere geological curiosity, Externsteine is also reputed to be an ancient and sacred palaeolithic worshiping ground, an astronomical calendar, and the location of a sacred pagan pillar known as an “Irminsul.” Externsteine is a current mecca for Neo-pagans, Neo-Nazis and neo-pagan-Nazis.In actuality, the pre-history of these rocks is largely unknown, and archaeological digs have turned up little to suggest they were of any great meaning to Paleolithic peoples. The odd rock formations were probably used as an occasional shelter until the late 700s when Christian monks settled at Externsteine and carved stairs and reliefs into the great stones. The site would continue to change purpose, serving as a fortress, pleasure palace, and prison before becoming something even stranger: a place famed for its history and spiritual significance despite the fact that the “history” is largely a fiction created by Nazi Occultists.The lack of evidence as to the ancient importance of the Externsteine rocks didn’t stop Heinrich Himmler from declaring otherwise. Himmler was the head of the Nazi’s occult division “Ahnenerbe,” a Nazi think tank that promoted itself as a “study society for Intellectual Ancient History.” In reality, it was a pseudo-scientific organization devoted to finding, or fabricating, a glorious Germanic past. One of the sites the society identified as an important location of ancient Teutonic activity was Externsteine and the “Externsteine Foundation” was set up to “investigate.”Pulled into the bizarre space where Nazism and Occult pseudo-history overlapped, the actual history of Externsteine was overshadowed by an entirely imagined ancient Teutonic history. Even the carvings of the monks were incorporated by Nazi pseudo-historian Himmler, with one in particular said to depict Christianity crushing a Teutonic pagan God-pillar known as an “Irminsul.” So far invested into this pseudo-history was Nazi Germany that according to author Gary R. Varner, the Nazi Youth gathered at Externsteine to sing pagan hymns during the solstice and on Hitler’s birthday.Today, the site remains in much the same historical chaos, with devotees of both Neo-Paganism and Neo-Nazism making pilgrimages to the site. Of course, other folks visit as well, and the site is fascinating even without the fictive history and cultural importance imputed to it. Made of five limestone pillars, the tallest over 100 feet tall, the site does indeed contain a number of astronomical elements (when they were created is still unclear) including a 20-inch window that aligns with the sun on the summer solstice. In addition, the stairs and relief carvings made by the monks add a real sense of meaning and awe to the place that has nothing to do with the crazed dreams of Nazi occultists.There is a Woodstock-like festival at Externsteine every year on the summer solstice.","Between Neo-Pagans and Neo-Nazis, these strange rock formations have a curious cult following and a very strange history. ","Karl Junker House,Hermannsdenkmal,Hexenbürgermeisterhaus","Golfweg 7, Haus des Kurgastes North Rhine-Westphalia Horn-Bad Meinberg, 32805",51.8692,8.9169,Sxoack sedKarenmbison,2010-04-05 00:00:00,"Hermannsdenkmal,Hexenbürgermeisterhaus,Karl Junker House,Bielefeld Viaduct","Mount Horeb,Visočia, the Bosnian Pyramid of Visoko, Prehistoric Trackways National Monument,Huayllay National Sanctuary",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/externsteine

1129,The Herbivorous Butcher,"trends,restaurants,food",354,840,"Whether for the purpose of health, animal welfare, or for environmental preservation, vegetarianism and veganism are surging in popularity nationwide. From 2009 to 2015, the number of vegetarians and vegans in America grew from seven million to a whopping 16 million. This surge in popularity has opened up a market for vegan and vegetarian restaurants across the country, including, most recently, “The Herbivorous Butcher,” founded in Minneapolis in 2013.The food for sale at the Herbivorous Butcher seems typical of that of any butcher shop - summer sausage, meatballs, salami, and chicken - but there’s one small difference: there is not a bit of meat in the entire store.The owners of The Herbivorous Butcher are Aubry Walch and her aptly-named brother Kale, both of whom grew up in Guam. Aubry is an 18-year-long vegan, and after Kale watched her create meatless alternatives to Guamanian cuisine for an entire decade, he decided to become a vegan as well.Once they both established their ongoing beef with carnivorism, they decided to start a business using the rare idea of a vegan butcher shop, and it turned out to be a job well done. They started bacon up their new recipes in the oven, and to ham it up they added unique meat-free items like the Sriracha Brat, the Mexican Chorizo, and the Huli Huli Hawaiian Ribs. They even created dairy-free cheeses like Garlic Pepper Havarti, Camembert, and Spicy Queso Blanco. The people of Minneapolis never sausage wonderful vegan options.Each option is homemade and carefully crafted, packed with a variety of flavors, textures, and nutrients.About 70% of the butcher shop’s customers are omnivores. Says Kale, “there’s a shift of empathy: people are starting to eat with their morals, with their conscious.” Considering that the store drew in over 5,000 customers on its opening weekend, the approach seems to be working.",A butcher shop in Minneapolis has all the meats and cheeses you’d expect from any of its kind—except that all the products are vegan. ,"Our Lady of Lourdes French Meat Pie,Ard Godfrey House,Twelve Vultures","507 1st Ave NE Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55413 United States",44.9904,-93.254,lewblankevilgreentrianglepaigeelizabeth3660,2016-05-26 00:00:00,"Twelve Vultures,Ard Godfrey House,Our Lady of Lourdes French Meat Pie,Our Lady of Lourdes Church","Restaurante La Oruga,Tai Tung,Tsaghkunk Restaurant,Criollito",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/herbivorous-butcher

The Citadella remains a symbol of oppression as well as liberty.A massive structure 220 meters long, 60 meters wide, and 4 meters tall, the Citadella was occupied by the Austrians until 1899. The locals, still angered by that symbol of foreign oppression started the demolition of the walls, however, most of the citadel structure still stands, and was subsequently used by both Nazis and Communists as a surveillance position, taking advantage of its amazing view over the city.The Nazis used the Citadella mainly as an anti-aircraft position and bunker. Once the Red Army advanced to the city and recovered the territory, the Citadella was used by the Communists as well. After the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the mounted weapons were pointed not to the skies but to the civilian population below.The Communists also took advantage of the high position of the structure and decided to erect a monument that would remind the locals of the sacrifice made by the Eastern liberators who freed the city from the German invaders.Once the monument was finished, it displayed five statues: A woman carrying a torch, representing progress; a man fighting a five-headed dragon symbolizing the struggle against the forces of evil (the Axis powers probably); two Red Army soldiers, representing the liberators; and atop the monument, a 14-meter statue of a woman holding a palm leaf with both hands up to the sky, representing liberty. Once the Communist influence vanished after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the statue of the Red Army soldiers were removed and taken to the Statue Park along with the remaining works of art honoring the invaders of an occupation that lasted four decades.Nowadays the Citadella remains a popular tourist destination. It is a fascinating site where one can see all the wonders of a city that has been called the Paris of Central Europe, as well as explore its troubled history.Update as of December 2019: The interior of the Citadella is currently closed indefinitely to the public. ","From Austrians to Nazis to Soviets, this historic Budapest fortress has a history as complex as the city itself. ","The Garden of Philosophers,Prince of Buda and Princess of Pest Statue,Budapest Cave Church","Budapest Hungary 47.4869, 19.0466Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyBudapest Cave Church0.30 milesThe Garden of Philosophers0.37 milesPrince of Buda and Princess of Pest Statue0.41 miles",47.4869,19.0466,luispachon007UddaUtflykterAty TrociousdrazsikananpalmerogigglingiguanadrazsikaAty TrociousUUddaUtflykternanpalmeroggigglingiguanareley250BlindcolourhanaMMike Portanovahrnick,2015-04-09 00:00:00,"Budapest Cave Church,The Garden of Philosophers,Prince of Buda and Princess of Pest Statue,Semmelweis Medical Museum ","Warsaw Uprising Monument,The Katyń Massacre Memorial,Soviet Memorial (Sowjetisches Ehrenmal),Executed Russian POWs' Memorial Graves",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-citadella-budapest-hungary

Smith was inspired by his father (also a master plumber) who had a penchant for mounting plaques and trophies. Smith noticed a similarity between the mounting boards and the toilet seats he worked with every day, and soon began collecting used seats that he would then paint or adorn with bright trinkets. Working in his garage, the space filled up over the years with his creations and once the local media caught on to his idiosyncratic arts, the attention was great enough that Smith decided to open it as a “museum” to anyone who wanted to take a look at his toilet seats. The gracious and welcoming Smith is happy to show off his garage collection to anyone interested enough to drop by. He even encourages visitors to bring in their own toilet seats since he prolific enough to always be running out. If someone does bring in a seat that he ends up using, Smith will engrave the donator’s name on the seat so that future generations will know where it came from. Smith is getting on in the years, but unlike many outsider artists, he has taken measures to preserve his artistic collection. Not only has his daughter agreed to look after the works when he passes, but the Bemis Company, one of the leading manufacturers of toilet seats has said that they would like to move the entire collection into their headquarters.Update: June 2019.

Federal Way is a suburb nestled between Seattle and Tacoma, best known for its strip malls and horrific traffic. It’s not somewhere you’d expect to find a botanical garden—let alone a sprawling, 22-acre oasis teeming with rare plants. In the 1970s, the Rhododendron Species Foundation was allotted a plot of land on the 400-acre wooded campus where a large logging company maintained its headquarters. What began as a small space for the foundation to house its burgeoning collection would later come to blossom into the world’s largest collection of rhododendrons.Rhododendrons are a genus of flowering plants that show stunning variety in their flower shape, color, and growth habits. Similar to the orchid, rhododendrons became extremely popular and highly collectible during the Victorian era, and continue to appeal to gardeners, botanists, and nature enthusiasts today. The RSBG houses over 800 of the known 1200 species. Here, you’ll find rhododendron trees reaching up to 100 feet in height alongside mounding shrubs, and leaves as long as two feet long alongside others a few mere millimeters. Flowers come in a breathtaking array of colors. This diverse collection of rhododendrons has been gathered by members of the garden’s curatorial team, who travel to remote mountains in the Himalayas, braving treacherous hikes and risking injury—all in the pursuit of plants. Perhaps the most striking thing about the garden is the wildness of it; it’s a far cry from the manicured botanical gardens you might be used to. Although it’s tucked away in a Pacific Northwestern forest of Douglas firs, cedars, and hemlocks, it’s intended to look like the mountains and forests of Southeast Asia, the native habitat for most of the garden’s collection. Besides its rhodies, the RSBG is known for its rare Himalayan blue poppies—striking, ethereal blue flowers with paper-thin petals. They’re notoriously difficult to grow, making the expansive meadow at the RSBG that much more impressive.

However, this was no last resting place for the dead, but a thoroughfare for the living who came to visit the Crystal Palace.After the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, the Crystal Palace was moved to Penge Common in South London. To bring visitors to the new exhibition site, two railway stations were opened. Both were (confusingly) called Crystal Palace, distinguished by their location: Low Level and High Level. The latter was built into a ridge below the road on the opposite side from the Palace, and to allow visitors an easy route, a subway was built from the railway terminus.The similarity of the subway to a crypt was no coincidence, as it was designed and built by cathedral craftsmen from Italy. Consisting of octagonal pillars, stone ribs, and a warm palette of reds and creams, the subway would have fitted with some of the exotic displays inside the Crystal Palace.The fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace in 1936 rendered the High Level station practically obsolete, and it was eventually demolished. The subway survived, though, and took on many roles in the following years. During the Second World War, it was converted into an air-raid shelter with bunk beds and terrible chemical toilets. After the war, children could often be found playing in the subway and the surrounding ruins; the ’90s brought ravers, and a brief period of fame in the video for the Chemical Brothers’ single “Setting Sun.”For some years, the subway was then closed due to safety concerns. The work of the Friends of Crystal Palace Subway led to some restoration of the structure, allowing visitors in on special weekends to see what for most of the year remains another of London’s secrets that are just out of sight.",A relic of Victorian grandeur hides beneath a busy South London road. ,"Crystal Palace Dinosaurs,Ruins of the Crystal Palace,Statue of Guy the Gorilla ","12 Burntwood View London, England United Kingdom",51.4221,-0.077,AmunyAnkhesenra,2019-06-21 00:00:00,"Crystal Palace Dinosaurs,Ruins of the Crystal Palace,Statue of Guy the Gorilla ,Ruined Victorian Folly","Metro Auditorio,London Underground Labyrinths,Moscow Metro Stations,Caños del Peral Archaeological Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crystal-palace-subway

An entire herd of these charismatic antlered beasts roams within Scotland.In the Cairngorm Mountains, you’ll find the United Kingdom’s only herd of free-range reindeer. Currently, about 150 of the hooved creatures call the rugged mountains home. They aren’t wild by any means—quite a few of them are put to work making public appearances or pulling sleighs during the holiday season—but they are allowed to wander as they wish within a 10,000-acre chunk of land.Reindeer once lived in the U.K., but the last wild ones disappeared about 800 years ago. In 1952, a Lappish man from northern Sweden named Mikel Utsi and his wife Dr. Ethel John Lindgren shipped a small group of reindeer over from Sweden to reintroduce the animals to the country. They chose to establish the herd in the Cairngorms, as the area’s unusual subarctic climate made it the only suitable place in the U.K.Their ecological experiment was a success. The reindeer have thrived in the often windy, dismal climate. They spend their days strolling around the hillsides, pausing to munch on a seemingly endless natural buffet of grass, birch leaves, and lichen (their feed is supplemented with grain, too).Because the reindeer are allowed to cover so much ground, it can actually be a bit hard to track them down at times. But pop in for a visit at the Cairngorm Reindeer Centre, and you’ll be able to meet a handful of friendly reindeer hanging out in one of the paddocks, waiting to greet curious visitors.

Since its opening in 1879, the graveyard has been the resting place for the victims of some of Washington’s most infamous tragedies.There, a mass grave holds the remains of the unidentified victims from the 1906 sinking of the S.S. Valencia. The ship foundered in foul weather in the Strait of Juan de Fuca while traveling with 173 passengers from San Francisco to Victoria and Seattle.Unable to make it to safety, the ship was battered by high winds and crashing waves. Would-be rescuers who could not reach the ship watched as the passengers drowned, succumbed to hypothermia, or were crushed as the vessel broke apart over a 36-hour period.Only 37 men survived and every woman and child onboard died. Of the 136 dead, only 33 bodies were ever recovered. Twenty-six of the corpses remained unidentified and were buried together in the mass grave at Mount Pleasant. The graveyard also holds the victims of a different transportation disaster that struck just four years after the Valencia sank. In 1910, a train making its way to Seattle became stranded in a blizzard. A lighting strike then triggered an avalanche on the slopes above the train, causing a cascade of snow to tumble down the mountain and take with it two train cars and the lives of 96 passengers. Mount Pleasant holds the remains of 18 of those lost souls, including six train employees who were never identified.Sadly, these two catastrophes aren’t the only unfortunate events linked to the cemetery. During the early days of World War I, yet another tragedy befell Washington’s working class citizens. While trying to unionize dock workers, five Industrial Workers of the World members (known commonly as Wobblies) were gunned down by city officials in Everett, Washington in an event that became known as the Everett Massacre. The Wobblies were buried together during a ceremony at Mount Pleasant shortly after the violent incident.Another Wobblie named Joe Hill, who was executed for murder in Utah and later cremated, had his ashes spread among 47 states (his remark that he wouldn’t be caught dead in Utah was apparently honored, and Alaska and Hawaii weren’t yet a part of the Union). During a ceremony on May Day 1917, his ashes were spread on the grave marking the victims of the Everett Massacre.",This graveyard contains markers and monuments dedicated to some of the darkest chapters in Washington's history. ,"Fremont Solstice Parade,Add-a-Ball Bar and Arcade,Fremont Bridge","700 W Raye St Seattle, Washington United States",47.6433,-122.3661,steedjbsdittmanmsmholtmanerjefferyAty TrociousMartinAty TrociousddjonesohmmsmholtmanerjefferyMMartinssdittman,2017-11-30 00:00:00,"Add-a-Ball Bar and Arcade,Fremont Solstice Parade,Fremont Bridge,Center of the Universe Sign","Brooklyn Theatre Fire Memorial,Los Ángeles and La Cruz Graveyards,Ross Bay Cemetery,'Kay's Fudge' Gravestone",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mount-pleasant-cemetery-seattle

To do so would alert the public and innumerable unknown spies to the existence of the bunker, thereby rendering the entire (read: top-secret) thing useless. Strategically located inside a hill in the Tagansky district due to its proximity to the Kremlin, allowing quick access to the bunker for Stalin and the premier tier of government officials within the USSR, Bunker-42 wasn’t completed until 1956 and was thankfully never put into use in its full capacity. Rather, it spent the subsequent three decades as an airstrike command base, communicating with aircraft transporting strategic bombers carrying nuclear weapons until the political climate began to shift in 1986.Today, the space exists as a historical monument that is equal parts museum to what life was like on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain during the Cold War era and tour of the previously top-secret bunker itself, bringing visitors below ground to a time when the world lived on the constant brink of nuclear annihilation.

An oval shape seems to float just above the trees at the top of a cliff, looking at the highway below. It would be understandable to think you’ve spotted a UFO, since the Sculptured House is known for its sci-fi history.Built in 1963, the Sculptured House has many names. Dubbed “the Flying Saucer House,” “the Sleeper House,” and “the Spaceship House,” the futuristic domicile was built by architect Charles Deaton. Perched on the top of Genesee Mountain, the eccentric private residence has appeared in a number of movies, TV shows, and photo shoots. Most famously it was used as one of the main sets for Woody Allen’s science fiction comedy Sleeper (1973), but it was on also seen on MTV’s Extreme Cribs, HGTV’s Home Strange Home, an episode of American Guns, and has also been included on Forbes’ list of Ugliest Mansions.The Sculptured House may look fascinating from the outside, but its interior is less impressive. Unfortunately Deaton ran out of money when building the home, and it remained unfinished and unlived in for almost three decades. In 1999 the home was purchased by entrepreneur John Huggins who worked with Deaton’s daughter (Charles Deaton died in 1996) to finish the interior.The Sculptured House is not a personal home today, but is used for private events, so look out to see what’s on the schedule, to see the former home of the Orgasmatron. ",This iconic science fiction house still looks like something from the future. ,"The Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave,Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum,Mines Museum of Earth Science","Golden, Colorado United States 39.7009, -105.2771Book a hotel on Kayak NearbyThe Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave3.03 milesMines Museum of Earth Science4.46 milesRocky Mountain Quilt Museum4.49 miles",39.7009,-105.2771,erinjeanMatthewHansenicatsstacibrandybatzSimon Jonesmaevekreillybbrandybatzmaevekreillykkcwatson8bbobs1415icatsstaciSimon Jonesrraymondwinn1941MMatthewHansen,2015-08-14 00:00:00,"The Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave,Mines Museum of Earth Science,Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum,American Alpine Club Library","A Christmas Story House and Museum,Ennis House,Chemosphere,Myers House",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sculptured-house

Supposedly the monster has the body of a man and the lower torso of a goat or sheep. It is also said to have short horns protruding from its forehead. According to differing reports the goat-man either uses hypnosis or some sort of siren voice to lure people onto the train tracks where they are then run down by passing locomotives. In other stories, the goat-man drops down onto passing cars from within the trestles.Of course these are all just legends. However the truth is that there have been a number of people who have scaled the eight-foot fence to meet their end on or under the bridge while “legend-tripping,” a pastime where amateur folklorists and monster hunters go in seek of their legends. Trains still rattle across the aging bridge and foolish trespassers have been known to be struck by the locomotives or fall off the bridge while climbing the trestles.

Porcelain fills the wooden racks set onto the walls, while gold leaf and vibrant blue pigments adorn surfaces showcasing elegant paintings of the room’s namesake bird. Hanging above the centerpiece fireplace is an exquisite painting by American painter James McNeill Whistler.Amazingly, this room was originally constructed across the pond in the 19th century as the dining room for Frederick Leyland, a London-based shipping magnate. It was meant to show off his extensive collection of valuable Chinese blue and white porcelain.Thomas Jekyll, a British architect, was the first mastermind behind the grand room. He added the delicate latticework to hold the valuable pottery, shelves, a Welsh dresser, a Tudor-style ceiling with eight gas lights, and a fireplace with gilded andirons. He also blanketed the walls with sixth-century gilded leather hangings that had entered England as part of Catherine of Aragon’s dowry.After a dreadful illness forced Jekyll to abandoned the project, it was passed on to James McNeill Whistler, an American artist who resided in England. After Leyland left on business, Whistler increasingly grew bolder and bolder in his decoration of the room, eventually even painting over the valuable wall hangings so their colors wouldn’t clash with the room’s focal point, a portrait called Rose and Silver: The Princess from the Land of Porcelain which he had painted.Whistler’s unchecked artistic vision caused Leyland to fire him. However, Whistler managed to keep working on the room. He sneaked in and painted two enormous fighting peacocks on the wall, which he aptly titled Art and Money: or, the Story of the Room. Interestingly, even though some of Whistler’s decorating was unauthorized, Leyland still kept the room and dined facing toward the inflammatory image of the two fighting peacocks.Charles Lang Freer, founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, bought the room from Leyland’s heirs in 1904 and had it taken down, shipped to the United States, and installed in his house in Detroit. He later donated it to the Smithsonian along with 8,000 other works of art to form the gallery now named after him.",This stunning blue and gold room changed cities twice before becoming part of the Smithsonian. ,"Martha, the Last Passenger Pigeon,Mummified Bison ,Carousel on the National Mall","1050 Independence Ave SW Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.888,-77.0264,horticulturcatUrsulaickaimpe1savage,2018-04-03 00:00:00,"Carousel on the National Mall,Martha, the Last Passenger Pigeon,Mummified Bison ,Smithsonian Sushi Collection","Uppspretta,Audubon Mural Project,Nebraska State Capitol Mosaic Floor,'Winifred'",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peacock-room

In fact, it’s the smallest house in all of Toronto and, probably, a much larger area. A simple house comes with a simple story: One day, Weeden noticed the tiny open lot on Day Avenue that was tucked between two existing houses and decided to build on it.Born in England, Weeden migrated to Canada in 1902, a full decade before he built the little house. For a time, he worked as the superintendent of the old Lighthouse Mission and later became known as one of the pioneer builders in this area of Toronto. Day Avenue, in fact, is still home to many of Weeden’s other projects.After he finished building the house, which is on a lot that was originally intended to serve as a small thruway for cars between these two existing houses, Weeden lived in it for twenty years with his wife. When she passed away, Weeden continued to live in the house for six more years. In 2007, the most recent owners renovated the entire space in an attempt to make it as useful and enjoyable as possible.

From 1953 to 2006, the iconic stainless-steel Americana food-temple served generations of good folks from the small New England beach town. If any Rhode Islanders care enough to wax nostalgic over the french fries and shakes of their youth, they’ll now have to go to Oakley, Utah. What’s now the “Road Island Diner” was manufactured for and displayed at the 1939 World’s Fair. Themed “The World of Tomorrow,” the fair forecasted trends in home appliances, entertainment, and food service. The eatery, a 16-foot-by-60-foot specimen from the legendary Jerry O’Mahony Diner Company, featured green Italian marble countertops, Tiffany glass clerestory windows, and hand-laid quarry tile flooring. It was bought shortly after the fair and moved to Fall River, Massachusetts, where it served as a functioning diner for 14 years before being sold again and moved to Rhode Island.In Middletown, the diner would stay in Greek immigrant Tommy Borodemus’s family for four generations, becoming somewhat of a local landmark. When the family sold their property to a Tim Hortons in 2006, the diner changed hands again, though this time its new home wasn’t just a state away. In 2007, the diner was transported from Rhode Island to Utah. Due to its size, however, the haul was forbidden from interstate highways. The several-thousand-mile backroad journey entailed state police escorts and pilot cars, but upon arrival in a small Utah mountain town, the historic diner found a loving home without any damage to all of its beautifully maintained original furnishings. The Road Island Diner now offers Utahns classic diner fare with an eye to the upscale. Standard burgers, fries, and shakes grace the menu, though Asiago dip, crab cakes, a codfish sandwich, and a trout almondine make comparatively star-studded appearances. “This Is Not A Fast Food Diner,” reads the menu.

The female (symbolizing yin) shelters a cub, representing nurturance and protection of the souls within a space. In this case, it seems the pair is tasked with keeping watch over the entire Mojave Desert and all who pass through.It is unknown how the lions got there. Standing about five feet high and elevated on cinder block pedestals, they were first sighted in late 2013, and whoever placed them there has never stepped forward to claim responsibility. Administrators of the lions’ Facebook page emphasize that they are not the benefactors. The mystery serves only to amplify their allure. How and why were two hand-carved solid marble statues weighing thousands of pounds transported here, four miles from the nearest town?Other mysteries circulate online as to the origin of visitor logbooks at the sites, and pondering the significance of a surveyor’s brass waymarker pounded into the earth before the female lion. Is this a geocache hiding in plain sight? And what is the significance of a real estate sign placed near the roadside north of the male lion? Whatever the lions’ origin, passersby have attached their own meaning. People leave coins, offerings, memorials, and words. Logbooks collect travelers’ musings; when the logs disappear, fans replace them with new notebooks, reproducing if they can what has been documented from the missing logs. The lions stand watch over an ever-changing landscape of meaningful gestures and tokens. Good luck and memorial offerings flooded the female lion after a May 2016 online report that she was damaged by a high-powered rifle (nearby the shooter had scribbled an apology on a piece of driftwood, claiming he didn’t know the target was precious). Among their ever-growing fanbase, it appears the lions have attracted guardians of their own.Update as of October 2018: Only one of the Guardian Lions is now visible. The other statue has been removed. Update as of January 2020: the missing lion has returned and both are now visible from the road.","A pair of large white marble lions guard this stretch of the Mojave Desert, and it is utterly mysterious how they got there. ","Amboy Crater,Amboy Ghost Town,Kelso Dunes","Route 66 Amboy, California United States",34.5602,-115.6423,sixpenny waxworksBrandoBlain80schic84rayewingphotoAvoiding RegretSimonTSSimonTyymark4BBigveganddonnanartker80schic84vegasgirl43rayewingphotoBBrandoBlainAvoiding Regret,2017-06-01 00:00:00,"Amboy Ghost Town,Amboy Crater,Kelso Dunes,Kelso Ghost Town","Bagdad Cafe,Fish Bowl Spring,Paisano Pete,Chicken Boy",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guardian-lions-of-route

Callaway believed the Torreya was the “gopher wood” that the Bible says Noah used to build his Ark.In his roadside kiosk, he displayed a Torreya log which he said was a remnant of the Ark. Visitors could pay $1.10 for admission into a wild unspoiled land of dramatic cliffs, rivers, and wildlife, and all proceeds from his “non-profit shrine” were to go to a local Florida retirement home. When Barry Goldwater lost his campaign bid, Callaway offered him a retirement home in Eden.Having left his hardline Alabama church as a youth and become an advocate for social and economic progress in the American south, Callaway eschewed the usual Biblical literalism for his own idiosyncratic ideas. His Eden was a contrarian, libertarian vision of perfect freedom, in which “Mother Eve” made the brave choice to eat the fruit so that humanity too could progress out of the garden; the trade of immortality for knowledge was a good one, in his estimation.Indeed, he peppered his 1971 book “In the Beginning” with references from geologists, numerologists, preachers, and other experts in various fields.

Visitors can listen to eyewitness accounts, or view displays and literature exploring the history of such monsters. There is even an interactive table where amateur monster hunters can explore a map of Iceland’s coast, following pop-up stories of the monsters seen at various points.  While reports of sea monsters greatly vary, there are four basic types that the museum says are endemic to the waters surrounding Iceland. Known as the the fjörulalli (Shore Laddie), the hafmaður (Sea Man), the skeljaskrímsli (Shell Monster) and the faxaskrímsli (Combed Monster/Sea Horse), each of the monsters have regularly reported characteristics that have made them identifiable at various sites around Iceland. Uniquely, Arnarfjördur claims to have seen sightings of all four over the years, making it a seeming hub of cryptozoological activity.Despite having no concrete evidence of any unexplainable creatures lurking in the waters, the museum treats the collected accounts of sailors and other seamen as largely factual. The cultural importance of sea monster stories is so closely intertwined with the beliefs of local seamen that Skrímslasetrið could almost rightly be called a natural history museum.  ",The Icelandic Sea Monster Museum explores the area's history of aquatic cryptid sightings. ,"Garðar BA 64,Selárdalur Valley, Samúel Jónsson's Art Farm","Dalbraut Bíldudalur, 465 Iceland",65.6867,-23.5977,EricGrundhauserandreakristinsaribrownerinculley,2016-07-22 00:00:00,"Selárdalur Valley, Samúel Jónsson's Art Farm,Garðar BA 64,Flateyri Bookstore","Cryptozoology & Paranormal Museum,Underwater Museum at Cape Tarkhankut,War Museum Askifou,Flatwoods Monster Museum",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skrimslasetrid
1156,Viking Village Film Set,"vikings,villages,film locations,film",193,837,"Have you ever wanted to unleash your inner Viking? Well, one location in Iceland is allowing visitors just that opportunity.By driving down a small gravel road twisting away from the main route between Höfn and Djúpivogur, curious visitors will arrive at what appears to be a remote Viking village in pristine condition. In reality, it is a film set for an Icelandic movie that was never filmed, but you’d definitely be forgiven for mistaking it for the real thing.Built in 2010, the set is located on the land of a local farmer. For a small fee, he allows visitors to wander around the amazing location, which is finally scheduled to make its debut next year in a film by Universal.Upon passing out of sight of the local Viking Café set up to entertain guests, visitors will be able to spy the fake settlement in the distance. The farmer’s horses graze nearby on the fields beneath the shadow of the mountain, adding extra authenticity to the surroundings. After entering the village walls, you are permitted to roam around the site at will. This offers the unique opportunity to observe the immaculate detail that goes into the creation of a film set.The most striking feature of the village is the buildings, which ape the architecture of the period magnificently. Guests can pry open the wooden doors and find themselves within a range of rooms that look almost indistinguishable from the real thing. But this is not the only piece of period detail; the settlement also comes equipped with a dungeon located beneath an enormous artificial boulder.The movie the village was created for was never actually filmed due to funding issues. Ever since, the location has waited in limbo for a production company to come along and use it. Recently, the wait finally ended when Universal acquired the rights to produce Vikingr, a film by the Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur. This film is expected to start production next year, with some of the filming taking place at the settlement.Meanwhile, the location remains open to the public. This means that those curious enough to stray from Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik can still role-play any pillaging fantasies.",This replica Viking village was created for a film that was never shot and is now open to visitors. ,"Red Chair,Rakkaberg,The Eggs of Merry Bay","Horni, 781  Höfn Iceland",64.255,-14.9933,JTYarwoodgollamallaroundjay,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"Red Chair,Rakkaberg,The Eggs of Merry Bay,Jökulsárlón ","Drvengrad,Los Albaricoques,Wikingerdorf Flake (Flake Viking Village),Rocchettine",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-village-film-set
1157,Fort DeRussy,"forts,military history,military,ruins",280,837,"Washington, D.C. was a garrison city during the Civil War.Early on in the war, the Union Army ringed the city with a series of 68 earthen defense forts. Most of these forts have disappeared, leaving nothing but their names across the region (Fort Totten Metro, Fort Dupont Park, Battery Kemble). A fragment of Fort Stevens, the target of Confederate assault in July 1864, is preserved as a memorial, complete with cannon and parapet, but more mysterious, and magical, is Fort DeRussy, which has been almost completely swallowed by forest. Located near the busy intersection of Military Road and Oregon Avenue, Fort DeRussy is accessible via a small, modestly marked dirt path into the woods of Rock Creek Park. Several hundred yards in, an even smaller path branches off to the left. And there, overgrown by trees and bushes, is a six-foot dirt moat which butts up against dirt walls a dozen feet high. The walls form a ring, enclosing an area about the size of a basketball court.Fort DeRussy’s shining moment came when confederates attacked Fort Stevens a mile to the east. The fort was heavily engaged during the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11-12, 1864. Fort DeRussy’s provided battery support to Fort Stevens to the northeast and also engaged rebel infantry north of the Defenses of Washington.. Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates’ advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.While its military career is long since over, today Fort DeRussy is still perfect for running maneuvers as it may be the best spot in Washington for a game of capture the flag.","A Civil War fort in the middle of Washington, D.C. has been swallowed by a forest. ","Peirce Mill Spy Station,Sharpshooter's Tree,The Capitol Stones","Western Ridge Trail Washington, District of Columbia, 20012 United States",38.9634,-77.0506,davidplotzhrnickblimpcaptainkunkmatthewbgilmore,2014-12-03 00:00:00,"The Capitol Stones,Sharpshooter's Tree,Peirce Mill Spy Station,'Cartwheel' Tower","Blockhouse No. 1,Fort Frederica,Fort Livingston,Remains of Fort Wadsworth",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-derussy

Now, over 75 years since the last of the Tredwells vacated, the house remains virtually unchanged, a veritable time capsule of 19th century life and a National Historic Landmark.In 1835, Seabury Tredwell, his wife Eliza, and their six children moved to Manhattan’s aristocratic Bond Street neighborhood. The family resided there until 1933 when Gertrude Tredwell, the Tredwells’ youngest daughter, died in the house at the age of 93. In 1936 the house was opened to the public, serving as a near-perfect preservation of the styles and architecture of its time and offering an intimate glimpse of family life among the wealthy merchant class. The museum contains a large number of the family’s possessions, ranging from examples of 19th century decor and fashion to more personal, mundane items such as bedsheets, chamber pots, and sickbeds. The stunning family garden and recently restored servants’ quarters are also open to the public.The museum attracts more than just history buffs; reports of paranormal activity at the house date back to the 1930s, shortly after Gertrude Tredwell’s death. Over the decades, accounts of unexplained phenomena, including temperature fluctuations, strange smells, disembodied voices and footsteps, sounds of parties and piano-playing heard from the street, and alleged ghost sightings have earned the house the title of Most Haunted House in Manhattan. The most frequent report is of a woman in a brown dress moving about inside the house; she has even been rumored to interact with museum visitors. Generally observed as a benign presence, the woman is believed by paranormal enthusiasts to be the ghost of Gertrude Tredwell.Visitors are invited to tour the Merchant’s House Museum Thursday through Monday with guided tours offered at select times. Guests who opt for a self-guided tour are provided with a large, exhaustive binder containing information about the house and its collections. Though the museum does acknowledge its paranormal significance, selling a collection of Merchant’s House ghost stories in the gift shop and offering annual Candlelight Ghost Tours in October, the museum’s main focus remains on the Tredwells and their place in 19th century society.Around Halloween, the Merchant’s House holds a traditional 19th century funeral and decorates the whole place in Victorian mourning decor.

Note the billboard on a nearby skyscraper saying simply, “Inner Trip.”Despite the fact that the complex looks like something out of Star Trek, the sect is less interested in laser guns than in promoting world peace. Though the temple may seem austere in comparison to traditional Buddhist temples, the monks are always amiable to visitors.

At the height of 659 feet, the mundane corporate headquarters needed some color and distinctiveness to brighten it up, and Sohio CEO Alton Whitehouse had just the plan.Whitehouse commissioned husband and wife sculptors Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen to design the world’s largest rubber stamp. The pair worked together for weeks to create a giant, 49-foot red stamp with the word “free” printed on the bottom. The word “free” was chosen because the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument of Cleveland was located directly across the street from the Sohio Building, which honors soldiers from the Civil War and freedom from slavery.Unfortunately for the sculptors, a short time after the stamp sculpture was commissioned, Sohio was taken over by British Petroleum (BP). Robert Horton, the CEO of BP, refused to give the project his stamp of approval. Horton apparently thought that the word “free” on the stamp was intended to mock and humiliate BP for taking away the “corporate freedom” of Sohio. Even though this accusation was unsupported and incorrect, Horton’s decision permanently banned the giant stamp from the property.The giant stamp was held in a warehouse in Indiana for the next six years until 1991, when the stamp was finally released to the public. The heavy object was hauled into Cleveland’s Willard Park, just a few blocks away from its original proposed location.

Given these factors, one of the cars ended up curling one of the tracks and the train partly derailed, grinding to a halt. The damaged cars were not flung from the tracks but instead had to be hauled off in a clean-up operation that moved the wrecks a bit deeper into the forest. Since the surrounding wildlife was not majorly damaged or destroyed, the cars were nearly instantly buried hidden in the overgrowth. Since the crash, the cars have become a favorite spot for graffiti artists and hikers looking to take in a bit of lovely ruination. In 2013, the site came to the attention of local authorities as access to the site trespassed on government land and required crossing the train tracks which is illegal.

Eskenazi became fascinated with collecting colossal shoes after discovering that his grandfather had once owned a shoe that had belonged to the World’s Tallest Man, Robert Wadlow. A bounty of $1,000 was offered to find the missing shoe; still yet to be recovered, the reward still stands. In the meantime, Eskenazi continued to collect other giant shoes, including another that had once belonged to Wadlow.After a graphic designer mocked up the boardwalk-style display front, the museum was pitched to the city and finally approved. Now visitors can step up to the stereoscopic-style viewing pieces and for just a quarter, the curtain pulls back to reveal some of the largest shoes they are likely to have seen. Among the shoes on display are the aforementioned Wadlow Brogue, a pair of “Real Clown Shoes,” a massive pair of novelty loafers, and an assorted collection of oversize shoes (this one costs two quarters).Fans of the odd and amusing would be hard pressed to find an attraction that speaks more to the spirit of the sideshows of yore than the World Famous Shoe Museum.

1168,Burro Schmidt Tunnel,"tunnels,memento mori,subterranean sites,monuments",112,836,"Stretching over half a mile through solid rock, the Burro Schmidt Tunnel seems infinitely longer when you consider the fact that it was built entirely by hand.The Burro Schmidt Tunnel was named after William H. “Burro” Schmidt, who built the tunnel himself starting in 1906. Schmidt had chosen a dangerous ridge to mine for gold, but refused to use his two burros to haul ore to the smelter on the available treacherous trail. Determined to find his own route, he decided to punch right through the mountain.With a pick, shovel, a 4-lb. hammer and the occasional carefully-placed stick of dynamite, Schmidt took on the ambitious and seemingly foolhardy task of digging his own tunnel. He braved falling rock and precarious traps, and despite the construction of a road in 1920 that eliminated the need for a tunnel, he continued to dig. Claiming to be obsessed and unable to stop until the job was done, Schmidt chipped away while others shook their heads, assuming he was crazy.Schmidt was crazy, but he was also clever. Keeping everyone rolling their eyes at his fool’s errand and playing up his “pointless obsession” with the tunnel that took decades to dig distracted from the true motive behind the lofty project – a substantial vein of gold he was following through the rock.  The tunnel still stands today as a memorial to the crafty miner who feigned obsession and kept his treasure to himself, but it also stands as a memorial to unbelievable grit and determination. That grit is exactly what it took to dig this impressive tunnel with no automated machinery, regardless of his motivation. More than that, it took over 36 years – itself a mind-bending fact to consider.Visitors can tour the property, walk through the tunnel and find a memorial plaque commemorating Schmidt’s achievement.",This impressive tunnel was dug entirely by hand over the course of 36 years. ,"California City: The Unbuilt Suburb,Randsburg,Saltdale","Burro Schmidt Tunnel Road Randsburg, California United States",35.4104,-117.876,snapsnazzysnmathewMartincarolelizabethdeweyroguetitanRachelssnmathewcarolelizabethdeweyMMartinrrenkesslerroguetitanAvoiding RegretRachel,2013-01-16 00:00:00,"Saltdale,Randsburg,California City: The Unbuilt Suburb,Lake Shore Inn","Bund Sightseeing Tunnel,Hoosac Tunnel,Naval Underground Headquarters,Doai Train Station",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burro-schmidt-tunnel

Alchemy—or al-kimia, meaning “the art of transformation”—became chemistry in the 1700s when Robert Boyle published “The Skeptical Chymist” emphasizing the scientific method. But the focus on understanding matter and how it changes is still very much at the heart of chemistry.Exhibits include Transmutations: Alchemy in Art and Making Modernity.

1172,Kojo,"coffee,restaurants,Unique Restaurants & Bars,history",98,837,"Kissaten is a Japanese-style coffeeshop that originally appeared before World War II. Once a massive craze back in the 1920’s, the term now refers to a retro, European-influenced type of cafe that has a nostalgic ambience of the Shōwa era (1926-1989). Many continue to exist in a past era that doesn’t recognize wi-fi, alternative milks, or to-go orders.Located in the ever-popular Ueno district, Kojo (officially stylized Kojyo) may be the most ostentatious of such specialty cafes, being an archetype of so-called shiro-kei or “castle-type” kissaten. Such type of cafe is characterized by ornate, sparkling lighting fixtures, European art, and classical music, and Kojo fully lives up to its name, which literally means “old castle.”Inside, you’ll find a large Yamaha Electone organ, a Tutankhamun mask, crystal chandeliers, and a massive, Art Deco-style stained glass window. Huge slabs of rock and fake plants divvy up the room, giving Kojo the feel of, to quote a reviewer on Japan Travel, “a mixture between a mountain cave and a southern European church.”Today, these stylized throwbacks stand in contrast to the country’s recent influx of third-wave coffeeshops (many of the Starbucks variety).

Burial mounds concealed beneath the surrounding greenery seem to bubble toward the surface, creating the illusion of earth rising to swallow the building whole.This fairytale-like building is the last turf church ever built in Iceland. Hofskirkja was originally constructed in 1884, though it was thoroughly restored in the 1950s. Unlike some of the country’s other turf churches, this one is still a practicing parish.The church is made from a timber skeleton surrounded by sturdy stone walls. It’s capped by heavy stone slabs draped in a cloak of greenery, which helps keep heat from escaping into the often raw, chilly air. When viewed from the back, it looks as though the building has begun to sink into the lumpy terrain. This is because the church is partially buried in the ground, allowing the earth to act as natural insulation.Turf buildings like this one once peppered Iceland’s villages. Using layers of dirt and grass to protect structures from bitter cold winters was a common practice throughout the region. It was particularly useful in Iceland, as the country’s early Nordic and Celtic settlers felled many of the island’s trees, leaving future generations with little available timber.But the turf trend began to wane in the 20th century, when concrete took over as the building material of choice.

It was started in 1854 and is set right in the midst of the area’s gorgeous rolling hills. Besides natural beauty, the cemetery also features quite a few excellent examples of funerary art. For instance, the William Stowell tomb, which features a tall set of hand-carved stairs cut into a single granite ledge. At the top, but not a part of the tomb, is a dead tree stump that has been roughly carved into a throne.Elsewhere, a life-size statue of a little girl leans against a flower-carved rail. The statuary marks the burial spot of seven-year-old Margaret Pitkin, who died in 1900. In the story that goes with it, a sculptor was commissioned to create the piece from a photograph. When the parents saw the finished piece, they were dismayed to discover that he had left off a button on her shoe…until he showed them the picture, which revealed that one of the shoes of the girl in the picture also featured a missing button.The John Hubbard grave is also a highlight and depicts the bronze statue of a seated, shrouded figure who seems to be writhing in the deep anguish of grief. It was sculpted by Karl Bitter to memorialize the grave of a local philanthropist who died in 1899. Less is known about the Frederic Dieter grave, which is topped by an amazing life-sized statue of a dead and prostrate Jesus being tended by Mary.

Below your feet scattered all around Manhattan are examples of the infamous Toynbee Tiles.These “tiles,” better described as adhesive patches that stick to concrete sidewalks and asphalt streets,  appeared around the East Coast in the 1980s and soon spread across the U.S. and into South America. The tiles usually feature a message along the lines of: “TOYNBEE IDEA - IN Kubrick’s 2001 - RESURRECT DEAD - ON PLANET JUPITER.”The meaning of the tiles has been interpreted as everything from a futurist utopian vision to a secret message from playwright David Mamet. (He denies this.) They are now believed to have originally been created by a 70-year-old Philadelphia carpenter by the name of James Morasco (aka Severino “Sevy” Verna) and copycat tiles now span the globe. The recent documentary “Resurrect Dead” tells the full story of the tiles and is the basis for the Verna claim. Spend a few minutes annoying New York residents and creating your own interpretation of the mysterious tiles.

1176,Hampton Court Maze,mazes,610,835,"The Hampton Court hedge maze is the oldest surviving hedge maze in the United Kingdom, a multicursal (unlike a labyrinth, which is single-path or “unicursal,” in a maze which is “multicursal” a visitor must make decisions) puzzle maze baffling and delighting visitors since the 17th century.While it isn’t nearly as large as modern-day mazes, it still provides a challenge and remains an important historical structure. The original design has since been modified due to gaps in the hedge, offering more ways to the center and more wrong turns, some of them ending in loops. It is constructed on a third of an acre, with half a mile of paths, within 60 acres of riverside gardens.Planted by George London and Henry Wise for William III of Orange in 1690, evidence points towards the current maze having replaced an even older one, possibly devised for Henry VIII or Thomas Cardinal Wolsey. The maze is now the remnants of what was once the many winding paths of William III’s “Wilderness Garden.” Initially comprised of hornbeams, the maze has since been repaired over the years and was completely replaced with yew in the 1960s.A project to restore hornbeam to the maze has been introduced, with hornbeam recently planted in the center to ascertain its viability in modern day wear-and-tear conditions. Unique at its time of development, the Hampton Court Maze provides multiple path choices and dead ends, whereas research shows that previous hedge mazes were unicursal, with only one path leading to the center.There are several accounts of people losing themselves in the maze, both in literature and reality. One of the most popular, if exaggerated, accounts of navigating the labyrinth is given by 19th century British humorist Jerome K. Jerome in his 1889 novel “Three Men in a Boat.” He describes one character studying a map of the Hampton Maze, announcing it should hardly be called a maze, as it is so simple. The three men proceed to haughtily navigate the puzzle, only to become lost and circle around the center repeatedly until they had to call for the groundkeeper’s help.The Hampton Court Maze takes an average of 30-45 minutes to complete, and though it is an ‘island maze’ which contains separate sections causing this technique to not normally work, the hedges are grown in a fashion where placing and keeping one’s right hand along a wall will lead them to the center.A recent addition to the maze is the audio exhibit entitled Trace. Spread across the hedges is a gentle “soundwork” composed of music fragments, snippets of conversation, the rustle of fine silks, and tantalizing laughter that disappears upon turning corners; aimed at luring visitors down certain paths, Trace is a permanent art installation that will eventually incorporate one thousand generated sounds.",England's oldest surviving hedge maze has been confusing visitors for over 300 years. ,"Anne Boleyn's Gateway ,Chocolate Kitchen at Hampton Court Palace,The Great Vine","1709 Hampton Ct Rd East Molesey, England, KT8 United Kingdom",51.4061,-0.3377,renakabambisonMartinErdaepfellieselNAlnwick,2010-01-15 00:00:00,"Anne Boleyn's Gateway ,Chocolate Kitchen at Hampton Court Palace,The Great Vine,Magic Tap","The Winchester Mizmaze,Cathedral of Thorns,'Fingermaze',Labyrinten vid Tibble (The Tibble Labyrinth) ",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hampton-court-maze

That’s because most people don’t know about the library cafe within the Swedish Church of New York, which offers enough god, comfort, and fresh-baked Swedish pastries for all of Midtown East to get their fika on.Formerly known as the Swedish Seamen’s Church, the house of worship hearkens back to a time when similar seamen’s churches dotted the globe to greet Scandinavian seafarers with a slice of home wherever they dropped anchor. Manhattan’s in particular greeted the million-and-a-half Swedes who landed in the Big Apple between 1820 and 1900. With changes in the shipping industry, the still-functioning Lutheran church serves fewer god-fearing seamen than it once did. The hidden cafe’s modest offering of simple Swedish comfort foods, however, makes steady churchgoers out of the city’s Swedish expats, tourists, and eaters in-the-know.The establishment largely caters to a Swedish clientele—call them on the phone, and they’ll answer in Swedish.

They were placed there by locals to appease the vengeful witches.According to local lore, in the late 19th century, this tree was the gathering place for a coven of witches. There they performed their ceremonies and generally didn’t create too much of a nuisance. Until, that is, a city planning committee decided to remove the tree ahead of the annual May Day celebration. This displeased the witches greatly. So much so, they cast a curse. And exactly 11 months to the day after the tree was cut down, the city suffered a storm so severe that it was generally assumed that the witches had made good on their curse and summoned a storm demon. During the storm, lightning struck the stump of the old witches tree and a new tree began growing there.

1181,45 X 90 Geographical Marker,"location markers,geographic markers,intriguing environs,ecosystems,monuments",261,835,"Tracing the earth are invisible lines. An infinitely fine mesh wrapping around the entire globe.For many years these perfect pathways, this hidden overlay, was of interest mainly to the sailors, explorers, and cartographers who bet their lives on them. Today we all have access to this ghostly grid via our phones, car navigation systems, and Google Maps. The twin brothers of latitude and longitude have become an intimate part of our lives, guiding us to and from our homes, and marking each step we take with a new number, each inch we shuffle down to, with thirteen figures after the decimal point, an atomic level of specificity.So what happens at the four magical spots that lie directly in between these most important of geographical ley lines? Stuck halfway between the geographical poles, the equator, the Prime Meridian, and the 180th meridian, what confluence of energy wells up from the Earth in the four corners of the earth found at exactly 45 degrees latitude, 90 degrees longitude? In Poniatowski, Wisconsin something kind of magical happens.After winding down some country roads, past the junkyard with its pile of 1950s rusting car bodies, and avoiding the horses and buggies used by the Amish in the area, you find yourself in front of a painted brown wooden sign with yellow text that reads:Geological MarkerThis spot in section 14, in the Town of Rietbrock Marathon County is the exact center of the Northern half of the Western Hemisphere. It is here that the 90th Meridian of Longitude bisects the 45th Parallel of Latitude meaning it is exactly halfway between the North Pole and the Equator and is a quarter of the way around Earth from Greenwich, England.Marathon County Park CommisionWhile it isn’t much to look at, Wisconsin’s 45x90 is only one of two of these spots found on land – the others are in the Pacific and Indian oceans – and of the two found on land, it is the only one that is marked as such. (Though, embarrassingly, it is marked incorrectly as a Geological Marker, when it should read Geographical.) The other 45x90 found on land, in rural China, is difficult to get to and it does not currently have a marker noting its significance.Today is easy to look down at your GPS unit and find out just exactly where on the invisible grid you stand, but in 1963 when owner of Gesicki’s General Store and Tavern John Gesicki began researching the invisible point, it wasn’t quite so easy. It took him some “five years to piece together the correct maps to pinpoint the exact center of the Northwest Hemisphere.” He then petitioned the U.S. Geological Survey to mark the exact spot.The problem, however, was that the real 45x90 was on private farm property and away from the road. So the best place for the marker was some 1063 feet away from the actual 45x90 spot, which is an unmarked piece of dirt in the middle of a soybean field. In 2017, an agreement was made with the farm owners who offered an easement to Marathon County. The marker is now in the correct location, with a packed gravel pathway, parking lot, park benches and signage available for visitors to more easily enjoy.However what is truly wonderful about the 45x90 spot in Poniatowski, Wisconsin is neither the sign, nor the spot itself, but the degree to which the local area has embraced their unique geographical location.After visiting the 45x90 spot it is essential that one make the trip into the nearby larger town of Wausau to stop by the Visitors Center. Once run out of Gesicki’s Tavern, since 2006 the visitors center has been the holder of the official “45X90 Club” registration book, on loan from the family. The book at a good six inches thick holds the names and dates of all those who have made the trek to the spot. It turns that a steady flow of people from all over the world care to come stand in an empty field just to appreciate what it represents. Not only does signing the book make you an instant member of the 45x90 club, you are given a commemorative coin as proof of your visit. Peter & Lou Berryman, Wisconsin folk singers, even wrote a song about it.  ",The center of the only hemisphere that awards visitors with a commemorative coin. ,"Timms Hill,Jurustic Park,Rudolph Grotto Gardens","5651 Meridian Rd Athens, Wisconsin, 54411 United States",44.9992,-90.004,michelleDebGlisagd22kamahonRachelPrestonWDDebGmmkpratorccarlyannh24SSara Anunsonjessicahawkkkamahonmmeganleighscottwwidirtiiolson1220spiff88MMartinddustinkollisagd22PPrestonWRachelSSculptor,2013-02-20 00:00:00,"Jurustic Park,Timms Hill,Rudolph Grotto Gardens,World's Fair Wisconsin Pavilion","Holme Fen Posts,'Krblin Jihn Kabin',The Equator Monument,Old Spanish Trail Zero Milestone",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/45-x-90-geographical-marker
1182,Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace Museum,"presidents,politics,museums and collections,museums",370,835,"Behind an otherwise innocuous (if immaculately maintained) facade in Manhattan, the childhood home of U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt appears much as it did when Teddy was a boy and includes an exhibit that highlights the bullet-riddled items from an unsuccessful assassination attempt.Originally built in 1848, Roosevelt’s large townhouse was used by the family for 18 years and saw the birth of the sickly boy who would grow up to become president. Despite being the birthplace of one of the most enduring figures in American history, even at the time, the home was demolished to make way for retail space in 1916. After his death in 1919, this grave mistake was rectified by a women’s group who set to work rebuilding and recreating Roosevelt’s childhood home in its entirety. Using a neighboring building as an architectural template as well as furniture and design advice from Roosevelt’s widow, the group was able to restore the site to the same comfortable state it was in in 1865.The birthplace still operates today as a living museum that highlights and honors the president’s roots and career. Among the artifacts on display from Roosevelt’s adventurous life is the shirt he was wearing when shot by a would-be assassin in 1912. The once blood-stained shirt, which was washed before it was installed in the museum, is now a lily-white blouse that still shows the hole where the bullet penetrated the president’s chest. Luckily, the projectile was slowed by a steel eyeglass case and a thick, folded speech inside Roosevelt’s jacket pocket. Being one of the manliest men ever to walk the Earth, Roosevelt shrugged off the flesh wound and went on to deliver the speech, despite the huge bullet hole straight through the pages. The life-saving piece of rhetoric is also on display.Despite bullets and wrecking crews, Teddy Roosevelt’s legacy lives on thanks to the very place where it started.             ",The rough and tumble president's childhood home displays the shirt he was once shot in and the speech that saved him. ,"The Players,The Former Offices of McKim, Mead and White,Abandoned 18th Street Subway Station","28 East 20th Street New York, New York, 10003 United States",40.7388,-73.9889,EricGrundhauserBlindcolouricatsstacidlc31723,2013-01-27 00:00:00,"Abandoned 18th Street Subway Station,The Players,The Former Offices of McKim, Mead and White,The Statue of Roscoe Conkling","James K.

1183,Cabaret Mechanical Theatre,"automata,amazing automata,inventions",116,836,"It’s not a theater and it’s not a cabaret, so what exactly is it? The Cabaret Mechanical Theatre is a collection of contemporary automata - a kind of mechanical sculpture - that functions as a kind of exhibition or museum. It started as a slightly offbeat crafts shop called Cabaret in Falmouth, Cornwall, more than 30 years ago. At the time, Sue Jackson sold simple wooden toys along with knitwear and ceramics that she designer herself. When Paul Spooner started working with Jackson, the designs grew more and more complicated.Usually people or animals, the automata are powered by motors, cranks, springs, heat, or hydraulics to produce motion through a series of cams or gears. Fascinated with the motion and spinning and action, Jackson quickly gave up knitting and ceramics to work on the automata; she saw how much pleasure they gave her customers.In May 1983, the Cabaret Mechanical Theatre began. Customers, Jackson and Spooner found, would pay just to turn the cranks and press the buttons that brought their creations to life. Most of the pieces on display, though, were built by only one or two artists. When business took off, Jackson commissioned more - and larger - pieces for her collection.Ever since, the Cabaret has continued to expand. With such a large collection, Jackson began sending some of her most famous and most complicated pieces overseas. The Cabaret Mechanical Theatre has now been brought to the United States, Japan, and countries all over Europe. “For Sue it is always a labour of love,” according to the Cabaret’s official blog. “It receives no subsidies or sponsorship, yet it helps to support a number of crafts people. CMT endeavours to remain a haven of wit, intelligence and individuality in an increasingly homogenous and mass-produced world.”Today, part of the collection is on display at the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. While part of the collection used to be on permanent display in Covent Garden, once the lease ran out, the only way for visitors to enjoy the automata is to find a traveling exhibit.

1184,Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel,"places to stay,trains,hotels,shops",1083,834,"At the turn of the 20th century, Chattanooga was a bustling hub of transportation. Industrial growth in the city led to overcrowding in its train stations, and in 1909, Terminal Station was opened to handle passenger rail service needs.Built in the Beaux-Arts style and sporting an 85-foot central dome and the “largest brick arch in the world” at the time, Terminal Station was the essence of luxury. At its peak, the station serviced 50 passenger trains a day, and several presidents are said to have walked through its doors.After World War II, however, passenger rail began to decline in favor of automobiles and airplanes. Fearing that Terminal Station would meet the same fate as many demolished stations around the country, a group of Chattanooga businessman banded together to save the station. Inspired by the 1941 song made famous by Glen Miller, they turned the station into a hotel and entertainment complex and called it the Chattanooga Choo Choo. The new hotel opened its doors in 1973, and in 1974 was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Today, beautiful rose gardens dotted with fountains, gazebos, and koi ponds fill the space where passengers used to board their trains. Shops and restaurants line the courtyard, and an operational trolley from 1924 gives educational tours of the grounds. Most notable are the Pullman train cars where guests can spend the night (though the Choo Choo also features more standard accommodations for the less adventurous).In 2014 the hotel began another round of renovations, hoping to kick off a second century as grand as its first.",This historic train station has been converted to a locomotive themed hotel. ,"Walnut Street Bridge,International Towing and Recovery Museum,North Shore Dance Paving Stones","1400 Market Street Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37402 United States",35.0373,-85.3068,sulliiiarc459Rindy99Collector of Experiences,2016-01-18 00:00:00,"Walnut Street Bridge,North Shore Dance Paving Stones,International Towing and Recovery Museum,Ruby Falls","Pera Palace Hotel,Hotel Alex Johnson,Aurora Express Bed & Breakfast,Utter Inn",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chattanooga-choo-choo-hotel

This area is squarely located in what is known ancestrally as Chickasaw land.  The son of French Canadian nobles, Timothy Demonbreun disregarded his titles and took up the life of a simple fur trader in Tennessee. After finding a spot along the Cumberland that attracted a great deal of game, he chose to stay in the remote area and establish himself, but with no man-made shelter around, he holed up in a small cave. The first resident of European descent in what is now Nashville, Demonbreun used this cave as a temporary home for several months while pursuing his livelihood as a fur trader and building a more suitable residence. Later a successful merchant and tavern keeper, this “First Caucasian Citizen of Nashboro” still has many descendants in the area today.The cave now seems like just a large crack in the rock above the Cumberland, but it is actually protected as a national landmark and the entrance is guarded by steel bars.","The small cave that housed Tennessee's ""first citizen."" ","The Nashville Clayscape,Lane Motor Museum,United Record Pressing","1700 Omohundro Dr Nashville, Tennessee, 37210 United States",36.1608,-86.7089,thudson3055adamleonard42choctawgirl84Shelly,2012-07-27 00:00:00,"The Nashville Clayscape,Lane Motor Museum,United Record Pressing,Hatch Show Print","Sassi di Matera,El Nido de Quetzalcóatl,Masitise Cave House Museum,Quinta da Regaleira",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/timothy-demonbreun-s-cave
1186,Cahokia Mounds,"ancient cults,rites and rituals,abandoned",1148,833,"The largest pre-Columbian settlement in the New World north of Mexico, Cahokia once had about 120 mounds, built for various purposes by the inhabitants of the area. One of these mounds is Monks Mound which, at nearly 100 feet tall, is the largest earthwork in North America from prehistoric times.Near present day St. Louis, Cahokia was a center of culture and religion for possibly up to 20,000 people of the Mississippian cultural tradition. At its height in roughly the year AD 1250, Cahokia was bigger than London. It was first settled around AD 600 and mounds were built starting about 300 years later. The settlement continued until perhaps as late as the early 15th century, when it was abandoned for unknown reasons. Many theories have been proposed for the abandonment , including invasion and warfare, as well as lack of game animals and deforestation as a result of erosion.Within the ceremonial complex there was a wooden monument built to mark the equinox and solstice, in much the same way that Stonehenge in England does. The remnants of the wood poles were discovered by archaeologists and a replica has now been built.The area now encompassing Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in Collinsville, Illinois has a long and sordid history. In addition to its status as a center of trade and culture, it also existed as a large ceremonial and ritual complex. One mound in particular, Mound 72, shows evidence of hundreds of sacrificial burials. Contained within the mound are 4 male skeletons buried together, all missing their hands and skulls.Also within this mound, skeletons in a mass grave were found with their fingers extended in to the sand surrounding them, suggesting to archaeologists that the people were alive when they were buried and were trying to claw their way through the dead bodies surrounding them. The skeletons in this grave were all of women in their early 20s, which further suggests that these individuals were not opponents in war but were sacrificial victims.Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.","Once one of the world's great cities, Cahokia was a place of religious worship, trade and mass human sacrifice before being mysteriously abandoned. ","Gateway Geyser,Illinois Woodhenge,World's Largest Catsup Bottle","30 Ramey St. Collinsville, Illinois, 62234 United States",38.657,-90.0587,bradenh83History FangirlevilgreentrianglebgpaulusNicholas JacksonWhiskeyBristleseevilgreentrianglecalvinsehrtHistory FangirlWhiskeyBristlesbgpauluskkazawolfwwinonaNicholas Jackson,2010-11-24 00:00:00,"Illinois Woodhenge,World's Largest Catsup Bottle,Gateway Geyser,Cotton Belt Freight Depot","Well of Santa Cristina,Orongo,Santa Marija Tal-Virtù Chapel,Narcis Hotel",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cahokia-mounds

Some 16,000 feet above sea level, at the bottom of a small valley, was a frozen lake absolutely full of skeletons. That summer, the ice melting revealed even more skeletal remains, floating in the water and lying haphazardly around the lake’s edges. Something horrible had happened here.The immediate assumption (it being war time) was that these were the remains of Japanese soldiers who had died of exposure while sneaking through India. The British government, terrified of a Japanese land invasion, sent a team of investigators to determine if this was true. However upon examination they realized these bones were not from Japanese soldiers—they weren’t fresh enough.It was evident that the bones were quite old indeed. Flesh, hair, and the bones themselves had been preserved by the dry, cold air, but no one could properly determine exactly when they were from. More than that, they had no idea what had killed over 200 people in this small valley. Many theories were put forth including an epidemic, landslide, and ritual suicide. For decades, no one was able to shed light on the mystery of Skeleton Lake.However, a 2004 expedition to the site seems to have finally revealed the mystery of what caused those people’s deaths. The answer was stranger than anyone had guessed.As it turns out, all the bodies date to around 850 AD. DNA evidence indicates that there were two distinct groups of people, one a family or tribe of closely related individuals, and a second smaller, shorter group of locals, likely hired as porters and guides. Rings, spears, leather shoes, and bamboo staves were found, leading experts to believe that the group was comprised of pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals.All the bodies had died in a similar way, from blows to the head. However, the short deep cracks in the skulls appeared to be the result not of weapons, but rather of something rounded. The bodies also only had wounds on their heads, and shoulders as if the blows had all come from directly above. What had killed them all, porter and pilgrim alike?Among Himalayan women there is an ancient and traditional folk song. The lyrics describe a goddess so enraged at outsiders who defiled her mountain sanctuary that she rained death upon them by flinging hailstones “hard as iron.” After much research and consideration, the 2004 expedition came to the same conclusion. All 200 people died from a sudden and severe hailstorm.Trapped in the valley with nowhere to hide or seek shelter, the “hard as iron” cricket ball-sized [about 23 centimeter/9 inches circumference] hailstones came by the thousands, resulting in the travelers’ bizarre sudden death. The remains lay in the lake for 1,200 years until their discovery.",A lake with hundreds of ancient skeletons surrounding it.

1191,Camac Street,"public works,lost wonders,roads",475,832,"Long before asphalt was the go-to replacement for cobblestones, city planners tried a number different materials to cover the roads including, in Philadelphia, wooden blocks.The bustling streets of Philadelphia circa the 1830s were a noisy place. Chief among the cacophony was the sound of horse’s hooves loudly clopping across the cobblestones, and a solution had to be devised. Thus the local businessmen teamed up with the city government and together they came up with the idea of paving the streets with sound-absorbing wooden blocks instead of resonating cobbles. Thus a number of the city streets were refinished with wooden paving using blocks of pine and oak, effectively muffling one of the largest sources of noise pollution of the day. Unfortunately sound was not the only thing the wooden streets absorbed.The blocks quickly began to soak up every bit of liquid that fell on them from rain to copious amounts of horse urine. In addition to expanding and warping into a bumpy mess, the roads became unbearably smelly (especially in the summer) as the pee-soaked blocks rotted and crumbled. The trend of wooden roads quickly fell out of favor, and by the time automobiles hit the scene, they were all but gone.However on the tight little 200 block of Camac Street, the wooden avenues remained. The area having developed into an artsy little enclave during the 20th century, the wooden roads were seen as a quaint oddity, but by the 1990s they had fallen into a dreadful state.

1192,Grave of Corinne Elliot Lawton,"catacombs and crypts,graves,gravestones,natural wonders,nature,statues",717,832,"Born: September 21, 1846 Died: January 24, 1877Her name was Corinne Elliott Lawton, and she is buried at Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia. She was born into privilege, coming from the very wealthy and proud family of Brigadier General Alexander Robert Lawton, CSA, Civil War.As the legend goes, when Corinne was of age, she met and fell in love with a man who was “beneath her station” in society. Her parents were dead set against her getting married to someone from “across the tracks,” and made arrangements for Corinne to marry a wealthy man of Savannah Society.After meeting the man her parents wanted her to marry, she told them that she could never love him, to which her father sternly told her, “You will LEARN to love him…or you will learn your station!” Time passed, and all the arrangements were made for the wedding: the gown, the church, the bridesmaids, the best man, the floral arrangements. She had sadly given up, and been drained of hope.The story goes on to say that one day before the wedding, despondent and heartbroken, she rode her father’s best horse to the banks of the Savannah River, leaped in and drowned herself in a final act of defiance. Angry and griefstricken, her parents had Corinne buried outside the family plot, then commissioned famous sculptor Benedetto Civiletti from Palermo, Sicily, to create her statue. She is depicted as sitting by a cross wearing a long gown with one shoulder bare. Her eyes have no pupils, a garland has slipped from her hand, and she looks as sad and lost as she seemed to be in life.Some consider her monument’s position to be a familial jab. Her statue faces away from the Lawton family plot, a lifesize sculpture of Jesus Christ smiling at her back. It’s a scandalous tale that’s often repeated on cemetery tours and in passing, but it is more than likely just creative fiction.Corinne Elliot Lawton most likely came to her premature end after a “short illness” — just as her obituary read. There is no mention in her mother’s diary about an ill-fated love affair, or any shame brought to the family in the wake of her daughter’s death. The position of her monument in relation to that of her family’s is probably due to the fact that her grave was relocated to Bonaventure after the death of her parents (who also had the statue of Jesus erected in their name).",This haunting tombstone comes complete with a heartbreaking story of love and loss. ,"The Bonaventure Jogger,Original Taco Bell Sign,Grave of Gracie Watson","330 Bonaventure Rd Savannah, Georgia, 31404 United States",32.0564,-81.0479,GhosterRachelmercierMark CaseyBoroBlackburndollymaedaggereeicatswolfnotesJJewels751Collector of ExperiencesBBoroBlackburnalysonsousa1andresrluzmmercierjjillmstrussdollymaedaggerPPrestonWRachelMark Casey,2013-03-21 00:00:00,"The Bonaventure Jogger,Grave of Gracie Watson,Original Taco Bell Sign,The Pirates' House","Gravestone of Henry Croft,Minerva Monument,Anita Garibaldi Monument,Grave of W.

Andrews book of the same name and tells the story of four siblings imprisoned and horribly mistreated in an attic by their narcissistic mother and sociopathic grandmother.Almost the entire story takes place in a palatial estate called Foxworth Hall, the exteriors of which were played by the real-life Crane Mansion on Castle Hill in Ipswich, MA. The mansion has been used in several other movies as well, including the 1987 all-star-cast “The Witches of Eastwick”.Built in 1928, the 59-room Stuart-style mansion was erected by Richard T. Crane, Jr., a wealthy businessman. The entire estate currently sits on 165 acres and is a national historic landmark that is open to the public for a variety of activities.The estate around the Great House, as it is called to differentiate it from the other buildings on the property, contains rolling hills, gardens, a trail system, Atlantic Ocean beach access, and various other attractions. Worth pointing out specifically is a pair of large black griffin sculptures located behind the house that were created by Paul Manship, whose most famous work is the golden Prometheus statue at Rockefeller Center in New York.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W.

1194,Old Tunnel Bat Colony,"bat caves,bats,tunnels,subterranean sites,caves,ecosystems,animals",226,833,"Just ten miles southeast of Fredericksburg is a deserted railroad tunnel, home to up to three million bats. The tunnel, decommissioned in 1941, is home to mostly Mexican free-tailed bats, as well as around 3,000 Cave myotis. Each night, from May to October, just before and during sunset, the bats pour out of the tunnel in massive droves, spiraling to upwards of 10,000 feet. The bats will travel up to 60 miles in search of insect prey, and can reach speeds of up to 60 mph.The bat emergence at Old Tunnel Wildlife Management Area (WMA) can be seen from either an upper viewing area, which is free, or from a lower viewing area, which has an admission fee but includes a tour guide. The upper viewing area is best utilized during August and September, when the bats emerge earlier and can be better observed. Red-tailed hawks can be seen diving into the plume of bats, snatching them out of the air in mid-flight.The tunnel itself was bored out of “Big Hill”, as the locals call it, about 920 feet through rock. The work was started in April 1913, and by August the first train had passed through the tunnel. Old Tunnel was carved in order to bring the railroad to Fredericksburg, which had unsuccessfully attempted to bring the rail to town many times.Unfortunately for the old German settlement, the railroad was not destined for their town, and the automobile would soon make their recently finished line obsolete. In 1941 the owners of the line sold off much of the rails, ties, and timbers, which ended up in a variety of places including the Alcan Highway to Alaska.",Abandoned railroad tunnel is home to a colony of three million Mexican free-tail bats. ,"The Cartoon Saloon,Seashell Graves of Comfort Cemetery ,Hygieostatic Bat Roost ","10619 Old San Antonio Rd.

Junior’s typical week is spent eating, getting pushed around in a stroller, and representing CLIMATES Exotic Animal Rescue. Oh, Junior is a 25-pound rabbit.The Bunny Hutch, which is part of CLIMATES Exotic Animal Rescue, is set up like a behind-the-scenes-only version of a zoo. It offers tours of its mammal room full of rats and ferrets; its reptile room containing lizards and snakes; and its outdoor area, complete with chickens and pigs. Visitors who show up at the right time can help feed chameleons, take a monitor lizard for a walk, or brush the bunnies.Among those rabbits is the famous Junior. At 25 pounds of pure fluff, he’s a mascot for the Bunny Hutch and the only animal at the facility who isn’t up for adoption. But he loves getting visitors.Junior’s father, King Darius, is the current Guinness World Record holder for “longest rabbit” (they measure length rather than weight to prevent encouraging overfeeding). He weighs an astonishing 50 pounds, and it’s been predicted that quite a few of his children may surpass his record. At three years old, Junior is only about 25 pounds, but he’s still growing.According to the Bunny Hutch, he’s the largest bunny in the U.S.—and no one has contended that yet. Junior was born in Worcester, England, in 2014. He was sent to the Bunny Hutch when he was about 12 weeks old. His breed, Continental Giant, is usually only found in Europe.","The home of pigs, snakes, chameleons, and the alleged largest bunny in the United States. ","The Witch of Pungo Statue,Edgar Cayce A.R.E.

1198,Dead Children's Playground,"playgrounds,haunted,graveyards,cemeteries",289,831,"Cemeteries can be boring for kids. The weight and import of death has not truly sunk in yet, so the cool headstones and elaborate grave markers must just seem like awesome rocks to play on, but no one will let them. They are going to live forever, so why is everyone so sad?Well in a park space adjoining Alabama’s Maple Hill Cemetery, the largest and oldest in the state, there is a small playground where they can have a place to release that energy. Of course this cemetery playground sees more ghost hunters and teenagers than bored children.It seems like simple math that a sparse playground built on the grounds of a century-old cemetery would come to have a reputation more sinister than silly, but the planners put it in anyway.The small array of simple playground equipment includes swings, and a modern jungle gym. It is set in a low spot of the graveyard and surrounded by rocks and trees on three sides, making it all the more claustrophobic.As the historic cemetery began running out of room in 2007, officials from the city of Huntsville decided to raze the play area to make room for more burials. Yet the locals were so outraged at the loss of their playground that a new playground was built, bringing the site back from the dead, so to speak.Today the playground is known to locals as Dead Children’s Playground and the mundane site has accumulated a deep catalogue of supernatural associations. As the believers would tell it, the swings can often be found to sway by themselves, spheres of cold ghost light can be seen floating around, and even the spectres of little kids have been spotted having a little midnight fun. Dead Children’s Playground, where kids can have the time of their afterlife.",What else would you call a playground hidden in Alabama's oldest and largest cemetery? ,"The Grave of Miss Baker,MPTA-098,Lowe Mill ARTS & Entertainment","Maple Hill Cemetery, 1351 McClung Ave SE 203 Maple Hill Drive Huntsville, Alabama, 35801",34.7315,-86.5652,emilydmonsonrebecaschandellysha,2015-05-29 00:00:00,"Lowe Mill ARTS & Entertainment,The Grave of Miss Baker,MPTA-098,Pathfinder and the MPTA-ET","Frenier Cemetery,Howard Mausoleum Pyramid,Dean Hill Cemetery ,Yanakie Station Cemetery",https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dead-children-s-playground-2
